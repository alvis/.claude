"""Verify that relative paths mentioned in shipped Markdown resolve to files.

Scans ``plugins/**/*.md``, ``AGENTS.md``, and ``README.md`` for markdown
links and backticked path tokens, resolves each against the containing
file's directory, every ancestor directory up to the repository root, and
the owning plugin root, and reports every mention that resolves to nothing.
This catches the real defect a prose assertion never can: a doc pointing at
a moved or deleted file.

Example code in standards and skill references names paths from invented
project trees (``services/user.ts``); those are recognized by an explicit
allowlist of example first segments, never by whether a directory happens
to exist — so a renamed or deleted real directory still fails the gate.
A line carrying ``doc-path-gate: ignore`` in an HTML comment is skipped;
it marks a deliberate mention of a path that must not exist.

Exit 0 when every mention resolves; exit 1 listing ``file:line → path``.
