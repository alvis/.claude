# Claude Code, Codex, and Grok Build Plugin Marketplace

Eight composable plugins for Claude Code, Codex, and Grok Build, with a best-effort OpenCode V1 projection: specifications with real provenance, plans with stable task identity, execution state that survives crashes and machine moves, and decisions that never silently rewrite history. Claude Code, Codex, and Grok Build are native targets whose harness-specific manifests are thin adapters. OpenCode V1 uses a generated best-effort projection; see the emoji-qualified [compatibility matrix](COMPATIBILITY.md) before relying on a harness-specific feature. This README explains how the system thinks and how to get the most out of it; each plugin's own `README.md` documents its skills in depth.

## How the system thinks

Everything in this marketplace is built around one observation: **long-running AI work fails less from missing memory than from stale memory** — an agent that remembers yesterday's plan perfectly and doesn't notice the world moved. The system therefore separates six kinds of truth and refuses to let one impersonate another (`plugins/essential/references/truth.md`):

| Kind | Question it answers | Lives in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Contract | What are we trying to make now? | `goal.md` charters, canonical specs |
| Decision | Why this, and what replaced the old choice? | decision records, ADRs |
| Execution state | What is happening right now? | `.state/` work state |
| Evidence | What was verified, against which exact inputs? | task evidence, reviews, receipts |
| Artifact | What was actually produced? | outputs named by revision or hash |
| Memory | What reusable lesson may help later? | agent memory |

Five rules are constitutional:

1. Never edit an accepted decision into its replacement — supersede it.
2. Never approve an artifact without naming its exact revision.
3. Never treat `done` as synonymous with `current` — status is history, validity is now.
4. Every derived artifact names the inputs it was derived from.
5. Deleting `.state/` must never erase anything consequential.

Practical consequences you will see day to day:

- **`.state/` is an operational projection, not the record of record.** It is ignored working memory — rich, continuously persisted, and not byte-reconstructible — held centrally in the default source tree, so every worktree and workspace shares one view of the work. Every state change, discovery, and decision is stored immediately in the journal and its owning state file; accepted decisions, approvals, and published artifact identities also live in versioned `docs/` and external anchors (issue, PR, Notion) via promotion records. The projection becomes disposable only after durable promotion and closure.
- **Completed work stays completed.** When a decision or spec change invalidates a finished task, its row keeps `✓ done` and gains `validity: stale (<reason>)`; new remediation tasks carry the rework. The system recomputes only what the changed truth touched instead of restarting everything — and history is never falsified.
- **Approvals bind to exact revisions.** "Approved" names the artifact, its hash or immutable revision, the reviewer, and the scope. An approval of v7 never silently carries to v8.
- **Concurrency is technical, not social.** One coordinator per work stream holds an on-disk lease (`state-lease`); state writes are atomic and bump a monotonic `State revision`; an append-only journal records causality so drift between tables is settled by evidence, not guesswork. A small read-only `state-doctor` catches structural defects (cycles, dangling dependencies, contradictory statuses) without ever judging prose.
- **Context is revealed progressively.** Small hook payloads carry shared and audience-specific instructions. Claude and Codex inject them natively; Grok receives bootstrap instructions, and OpenCode V1 uses its context adapter. Contracts load on demand at the moment they matter, so agents spend context on your work, not on ceremony.

## Install

### Claude Code

```bash
cd /path/to/target-project
claude plugin marketplace add alvis/.claude --scope project
claude plugin install specification@alvis --scope project
```

`specification` is the recommended end-to-end bundle; its declared dependencies install `coding` and `essential`. After installation, ask Claude to run `/essential:install`, restart the session, and run `/reload-plugins` after marketplace updates.

| Scope | Use |
|---|---|
| `local` | Try the plugin privately in one target checkout. |
| `project` | Record the plugin for collaborators in the target project. |
| `user` | Enable it for the current developer across projects. |

Project scope writes marketplace and enabled-plugin declarations to the target's `.claude/settings.json`; review before committing. Keep `NOTION_TOKEN` and every other credential out of project settings and version control.

### Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add alvis/.claude
codex plugin add essential@alvis
codex plugin add coding@alvis
codex plugin add specification@alvis
```

Codex reads `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, a structural projection of the authoritative Claude catalog. Install the workflow's listed plugins explicitly because Claude's plugin dependency metadata is harness-specific. Ask Codex to run `essential:install` for the Codex harness, then start a fresh session so the native TOML specialist definitions are loaded. Context loading does not depend on specialist installation. Open `/hooks` after installation and trust the bundled plugin hooks; Codex skips new or changed context-injection hooks until their definitions are reviewed.

In T3-hosted Plan Mode, Codex emits the plan without a plan-transition tool call. Essential therefore validates the current turn's `<proposed_plan>` from the Codex transcript at Stop and requests one corrected response when needed. The first malformed plan may render before that feedback arrives.

### Grok Build

```bash
cd /path/to/claude-marketplace-checkout
grok plugin install plugins/specification --trust
```

Grok reads `.grok-plugin/marketplace.json`, a structural projection of the authoritative Claude catalog, and validates each plugin's thin `.grok-plugin/plugin.json` adapter. Install is source-scoped: `grok plugin install` takes a local path directly and `--trust` enables it, while `marketplace add` only lists discovery entries.

Ask Grok to run [essential:install](plugins/essential/skills/install/SKILL.md). It stitches this repository's agent templates into Grok's personal agent directory and adds a managed reference to [GROK.md](plugins/essential/directions/GROK.md) in the user `AGENTS.md`. Start a fresh session afterward. The bootstrap directs Grok to a loader that discovers enabled plugins and returns their instructions for the current main or subagent session. Grok 1.0.30 read the bootstrap but did not reliably execute those instructions; see [compatibility](COMPATIBILITY.md) for the observed limits.

Grok's `SessionStart` and `SubagentStart` handlers still ignore stdout; the bootstrap supplies the missing instruction route. Native tool guards remain registered. See [compatibility](COMPATIBILITY.md) for the verified behavior and limits.

### OpenCode V1

Project a selected plugin and its recursive dependencies into a target Git worktree:

```bash
bun /path/to/.agents/scripts/install_opencode.ts \
  --scope project \
  --project-root /path/to/target-project \
  --plugin specification
```

Install selected plugins for the current user, or project every marketplace plugin:

```bash
bun scripts/install_opencode.ts --scope user --plugin essential --plugin coding
bun /path/to/.agents/scripts/install_opencode.ts \
  --scope project --project-root /path/to/target-project --all
```

The installer projects the current Git worktree's tracked and non-ignored untracked regular files. It rejects source symlinks before target mutation, so ignored environments, caches, and build output do not leak into the projection and every managed output remains a regular file. Repeating the same install is byte-stable.

Only managed paths beneath `.opencode/` or `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/opencode/` are written; `opencode.json` and `opencode.jsonc` are never edited. Schema-v2 receipts record source hashes and resolved hook mappings in `alvis/manifest.json`. <!-- doc-path-gate: ignore --> An external target-bound ownership and recovery record under `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/alvis-opencode-v1/` prevents a copied or forged project receipt from claiming user files and lets the next non-dry run roll back a hard-interrupted install. An authenticated schema-v1 projection is migrated transactionally; modified, unowned, current-schema non-regular, and genuinely colliding paths remain fatal. OpenCode names are hyphenated to satisfy its skill and command rules: `coding:pr` becomes the `coding-pr` skill and `/coding-pr` command. Rerun the installer after updating this source checkout.

OpenCode support targets stable V1 only. OpenCode V2 and `opencode2` are not supported. The adapter executes receipt-bound hooks with a child-only `PLUGIN_ROOT`; it neither changes the parent environment nor alters Claude, Codex, or Grok's native root-variable precedence. OpenCode's before/after tool events preserve supported denials, advice, diagnostics, and commit rewrite checks. The system-transform hook remains experimental, Stop is advisory, and V1 exposes no enforceable plan-transition event; the compatibility matrix states these limits explicitly.

The core lifecycle expects Claude Code, Codex, or Grok Build, Bash, `jq`, Git, and Bun, plus the target project's own build and test tools. The publication path additionally expects an authenticated `gh`; it prefers `jj` where the repository is jj-colocated and uses Git directly everywhere else. Notion synchronization is optional — see [the specification plugin README](plugins/specification/README.md) for its transport-profile requirements.

The source and manually maintained projection boundaries are documented in [Harness projections](docs/architecture/harness-projections.md).

## The lifecycle, end to end

A work stream is born, executes, and retires through one continuous discipline:

1. **Bootstrap.** The main agent selects a stable Work ID from task context and existing charters, the resolver enforces the `.state/` ignore gate, and a no-clobber bootstrap creates the charter (`goal.md`), state (`state.md`), focus pointer (`state/working.md`), and journal.
2. **Charter.** `goal.md` owns the goal, scope, and numbered success criteria (`SC-1`…) with expected evidence — so status churn can never drift the definition of done. It also declares the stream's workspace anchors (a git worktree by default; media projects and asset stores for production work).
3. **Lease.** The coordinator acquires the stream's on-disk lease before any state write. Two sessions can never both believe they own a stream; an expired lease yields only to an explicit, journaled takeover.
4. **Specify and plan.** Specs carry provenance and approval binds to exact content; plans are task tables with stable three-letter IDs, explicit dependency graphs, and per-task acceptance.
5. **Execute.** Every status change is journaled first, then reconciled into the tables ("append first, reconcile second"). Workers return evidence with their `capability_id`; only the lease holder writes state.
6. **Decide.** Decisions record what they supersede, affect, invalidate, and preserve. Acceptance triggers a blast-radius sweep that marks stale work and spawns remediation, journaled as one sweep.
7. **Review and approve.** Seven canonical review areas; every approval carries the full binding tuple. Spec freshness is re-checked at named moments (before planning, each dispatch batch, review, completion).
8. **Pause and resume.** `essential:handover` persists everything into `.state/` and refreshes the cross-tree overview; `essential:takeover` resumes from those on-disk files, checks the lease, and drives streams to their success criteria (`essential:doctor` owns structural audits).
9. **Promote and retire.** Stable knowledge promotes to versioned `docs/` with provenance; every accepted decision gets an explicit disposition (promote to ADR / product / production record, retain in receipt, or archive); only then is it removed from the live index and permanently archived.

### Golden development lifecycle

| Stage | Developer action | Owner and gate |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Start | Name the target repository, tracker-derived work ID, scope, and success criteria. | The PM resolves one workspace-local work root and bootstraps it only after the ignore gate. |
| 2. Discover | Run `/essential:discover` for blind spots, references, or a disposable prototype. | Discovery records evidence separately from its marked `DSC01`-style task graph and says whether the work is ready for a decision. |
| 3. Decide | Run `/essential:decide` only when material alternatives need a choice. | After approval, Decide records the decision with its causal metadata and invokes the selected next owner itself. Do not invoke that owner a second time. |
| 4. Specify | If no prior Decide handoff already invoked it, run `/specification:spec-code` with one explicit local, inline, or Notion source and a capability slug. | Approve the exact specification content, confirmed by direct comparison. A transport mirror is never the authored source. |
| 5. Plan | Run `/specification:plan-code` against that specification. | Approve the task definitions and dependency graph recorded in `state.md` before implementation; changing them later requires reapproval. |
| 6. Implement | Run `/specification:implement-code --defer-publication` when you want the manual save/finalize/publish stops shown below; use `/coding:write-code` directly only for a non-specification coding task. | Execute only dependency-ready leaf task IDs using target-native tests. Child writers return status evidence; the coordinator alone reconciles work state. |
| 7. Document | Let implementation invoke `/coding:document` when public behavior, configuration, operations, or developer workflow changed. | Documentation finishes before review and save-manifest sealing. |
| 8. Review, lint, and repair | Let implementation run review, fixes, touched-scope lint, and final target-native checks. | All findings block closure. A correction reruns affected tests/reviews. |
| 9. Reconcile the spec | Let implementation run the applicable Notion completion gate or local source/work-local-specification recheck. | A change in specification content invalidates plan/code/review evidence; done tasks keep their status and gain stale validity with remediation tasks. |
| 10. Save and finalize | On deferred `needs_save`, run the exact returned `/coding:commit --paths-from=... --manifest-sha256=...`; on `ready_for_finalization`, skip save; on `no_change`, stop. Then `/coding:finalize-commits` once. | The closed-set save preserves unrelated staged and dirty developer work. |
| 11. Publish | If no PR was already published, run `/coding:pr create` only when the GitHub and `gh` prerequisites are satisfied; use `/coding:pr update` for an existing PR. | It creates or updates PRs initially as drafts, promotes fully approved surfaces to ready for review, and monitors CI. |
| 12. Close or pause | After execution, review, and decision dispositions, set the work `reviewing` with its external landing or acceptance wait as a blocker. Coding work becomes `completed` on merge/default-branch evidence; non-coding work becomes `completed` on explicit acceptance plus a promotion receipt listing durable paths or evidenced `not required`. `/essential:takeover` checks the applicable landing evidence on a later run. Or run `/essential:handover`. | Every required executable leaf must be done. Coding work records its pull request(s); non-coding work records its reviewed deliverables and required accepter. Completion clears the resolved submission blocker and retains only independently unresolved blockers. A pause leaves the whole stream in `.state/works/<work-id>/`, ready for `/essential:takeover`. |

When the target is a standalone or non-TypeScript repository, verify each selected skill against the repository's native commands before use.

### Five-minute local-spec path

Use a lowercase tracker-derived ID that will remain stable, such as `eng-421-checkout-refunds`:

```text
/essential:discover "Find delivery blind spots for checkout refunds" --work-id=eng-421-checkout-refunds --mode=blindspots --persist
/specification:spec-code "Design idempotent checkout refunds from these requirements" --work-id=eng-421-checkout-refunds --capability=checkout-refunds
/specification:plan-code --work-id=eng-421-checkout-refunds
/specification:implement-code --work-id=eng-421-checkout-refunds --repo=/absolute/path/to/target-project --defer-publication
```

This path avoids Notion and remote publication entirely. It leaves verified code, work-local evidence, reviews, and the approved specification source. The deferred result tells you what remains (`needs_save`, `ready_for_finalization`, or `no_change`); follow stage 10 above. Add Notion or PR publication only after the local flow is understood.

## The plugins

| Plugin | What it owns | README |
|---|---|---|
| `essential` | The state lifecycle backbone: truth model, work state, lease, journal, doctor, pause/resume, research and decision skills, agent installer. Every other plugin depends on it. | [plugins/essential](plugins/essential/README.md) |
| `specification` | Specs with provenance: authoring, planning, implementation orchestration, seven-area review, and safe Notion synchronization. | [plugins/specification](plugins/specification/README.md) |
| `coding` | General code production: TDD write/fix/refactor, GitHub issues, scoped saves, stacked PRs, lint, docs, cleanup. | [plugins/coding](plugins/coding/README.md) |
| `governance` | The meta-layer: creating and verifying agents, skills, and standards. | [plugins/governance](plugins/governance/README.md) |
| `client` | Client-facing screen-design contracts with Notion integration. | [plugins/client](plugins/client/README.md) |
| `react` | React/JSX standards routing over the shared coding workflows. | [plugins/react](plugins/react/README.md) |
| `web` | Web UX design, audits, imaging, Next.js diagnosis, Storybook checks. | [plugins/web](plugins/web/README.md) |
| `production` | Media/creative production: asset provenance, render manifests, revision-bound review. | [plugins/production](plugins/production/README.md) |

## Work state and recovery

- `.state/works/<work-id>/` is ignored coordination memory — an operational projection rather than a record of record. It lives in the default source tree only, so every worktree resolves to the same streams, and it is self-contained: state, decisions, specification, and `artifacts/` sit together under that one directory.
- `working.md` is the short current-focus pointer; `state.md` is the complete lifecycle, plan, task graph, and evidence index; `state/journal.md` is the append-only causal record the tables are views over.
- Tasks use stable IDs (`LFE`, `LFE01`) that are never renamed or reused; removed scope becomes a cancelled tombstone. Every task shows a mark and word (`- planned`, `⧗ working`, `✓ done`, `X failed`, `! blocked`, `⊘ cancelled`); validity is a separate dimension.
- To pause, run `/essential:handover`; to resume, `/essential:takeover`. The pause writes nothing but state, so it always completes — a stream whose code is still an uncommitted working copy is paused and resumed like any other.
- `.state/` is ignored, so one reflexive `git clean -fdx` deletes it. Active state is not byte-reconstructible: keep a copy outside the repository until durable promotion and closure; `essential:doctor` checks a restored tree's structural integrity before it is resumed.
- Handover and takeover write only under the default source tree's `.state/` (and the active tree's `docs/` at promotion). A continuation file anywhere else — `/tmp`, `.local/`, the repo root — is a bug, including when output is too large for a response.
- Full detail, including the lease and doctor tools: [plugins/essential/README.md](plugins/essential/README.md).

## Agent team

A cross-harness 22-agent team is organized into a main-session Project Manager, domain leads, and their teammates. Shared operation lives in `plugins/essential/hooks/ALLAGENT.md` and `plugins/essential/hooks/MAINAGENT.md`, subagent conduct lives in `plugins/essential/directions/subagent.md`, a subagent's one mandated pre-read from `plugins/essential/hooks/SUBAGENT.md`, the scripted-execution proxy protocol lives in `plugins/essential/references/scripted-execution.md`, owner-specific routing lives in each contributing plugin's `plugins/<owner>/hooks/ALLAGENT.md`, and per-agent delegation topology lives in each agent definition. A plugin that owns an injected domain policy carries a `plugins/<owner>/hooks/MAINAGENT.md`, injected at `SessionStart` only: `coding` selects topology by semantic risk and `web` binds design initiatives to `design-lead`. Each lead wraps its `## Collaboration` map in an `<IMPORTANT>` tag, marking it as the map the lead routes from.

Use [essential:install](plugins/essential/skills/install/SKILL.md) to install or refresh agents in Claude Code, Codex, or Grok Build. It stages definitions from the canonical split templates, protects conflicting files, and records ownership for [essential:uninstall](plugins/essential/skills/uninstall/SKILL.md). Uninstall preserves edited and unrelated files. Grok installation also manages its startup attachment; the other harnesses never touch Grok configuration. OpenCode V1 retains its own projector. Changes take effect in the next session.

Each agent's `## Collaboration` section records proven role-level collaborators and delegation targets using role-only definition names. These are runtime defaults, not an allowlist; naming, `agent_id` messaging, main-agent brokering, and nested-spawn policy live in `plugins/essential/hooks/ALLAGENT.md`.

The Claude adapter gives each agent project-scoped memory at `.claude/agent-memory/<role>/MEMORY.md`; Codex and Grok Build keep memory harness-owned. Definitions state the durable role-specific knowledge to retain, while `essential:templates/memory.md` defines the shared evidence, freshness, contradiction, archival, and size-control contract. Memory writers keep filesystem write and edit capabilities available without new hooks; source-read-only roles restrict them to memory by charter.

### Delegation topology

Role-routing defaults (the main agent may reuse a matching live `agent_id` or spawn a new named teammate):

```
Project Manager (forms and names teams; brokers the user and session tools)
  ├── tech-lead (engineering-domain lead; decomposes work; owns technical decisions and delivery)
  │   └── any registered teammate
  ├── design-lead ──► frontend-designer, frontend-implementer, desktop-implementer, mobile-implementer, aesthetic-evaluator
  └── ai-research-lead ──► ml-engineer, harness-eval-engineer, data-architect
generalist-engineer ──► data-architect, code-quality-critic, test-runner, testing-evangelist, principal-engineer, tech-lead
data-architect ──► ml-engineer, test-runner, principal-engineer, code-quality-critic
principal-engineer ──► security-champion, test-runner, code-quality-critic
frontend-designer ──► aesthetic-evaluator, frontend-implementer, desktop-implementer, mobile-implementer
frontend-implementer ──► aesthetic-evaluator, code-quality-critic, test-runner, frontend-designer, tech-lead
desktop-implementer/mobile-implementer ──► aesthetic-evaluator, code-quality-critic, test-runner, frontend-designer, design-lead
devops ──► code-quality-critic, security-champion, test-runner; escalates to principal-engineer
ml-engineer ──► data-architect, test-runner, principal-engineer, code-quality-critic
harness-eval-engineer ──► testing-evangelist, code-quality-critic, test-runner, tech-lead
code-quality-critic ──► security-champion, adversarial-red-team
security-champion ──► adversarial-red-team
workflow-optimizer ──► runtime specialists for bounded audit slices and second opinions
```

Leaf-by-charter agents: `testing-evangelist`, `specification-expert`, `project-initializer`, `aesthetic-evaluator`, `adversarial-red-team`, and `test-runner`. Like every agent definition, they omit `tools` and inherit the runtime tool surface; their charter prohibits nested spawning. They message the best-known peer directly by `agent_id`; only when they cannot identify the owner do they ask the main agent to suggest one.

Team hand-off edges are documented by role for readability, but every direct teammate-messaging capability call targets the captured runtime `agent_id`:

```
design-lead → frontend-designer/frontend-implementer/desktop-implementer/mobile-implementer: initiative slice per platform
design-lead → aesthetic-evaluator: initiative sign-off
ai-research-lead → ml-engineer/harness-eval-engineer/data-architect: research or experiment slice
code-quality-critic → tech-lead: gate pass, or two rounds exhausted
testing-evangelist → frontend-implementer/generalist-engineer: coverage gap found
frontend-designer → frontend-implementer/desktop-implementer/mobile-implementer: approved design handoff
frontend-implementer/desktop-implementer/mobile-implementer → aesthetic-evaluator: build complete, fidelity check
data-architect ↔ ml-engineer: schema design and data-profiling consults
harness-eval-engineer ↔ testing-evangelist: test-strategy and harness alignment
any producer → principal-engineer: blocked on a hard technical problem
any agent → main agent: scripted-execution launch request (see plugins/essential/references/scripted-execution.md)
```

Only the main agent names persistent teammates. It chooses one of the three short names in the role description, formats `<short-name>-<role>-<task>`, and avoids collisions. Nested agents may spawn only certainly one-off helpers, specify `subagent_type`, and omit configured names; for continuing work they message the best-known teammate directly by `agent_id` and ask the main agent to suggest an owner only when they cannot identify one.

### Team shapes

- **Domain leads**: `tech-lead` for Tier 3 coding delivery, `design-lead` for design initiatives, and `ai-research-lead` for research initiatives.
- **Warm-core specialists** (trusting, low-friction hand-offs): `code-quality-critic`, `testing-evangelist`, `generalist-engineer`, `harness-eval-engineer`.
- **On-demand specialists**: `principal-engineer`, `data-architect`, `frontend-designer`, `frontend-implementer`, `desktop-implementer`, `mobile-implementer`, `ml-engineer`, `security-champion`, `aesthetic-evaluator`, `adversarial-red-team`, `specification-expert`, `project-initializer`.
- **Background** (one run per spawn): `devops`, `workflow-optimizer`.
- **Mechanical**: `test-runner`.

### Review and write fences

- **Independent review** is shared conduct, not per-agent machinery: whoever spawns an agent owns its output quality, each producer's own convergence predicate holds it to a clean independent review, and changed-code completion is recorded with the `REVIEWED:` attestation. The rule and its exact attestation format live in [plugins/essential/directions/orchestration.md](plugins/essential/directions/orchestration.md).
- **Write-fenced critics** (PreToolUse fence): `code-quality-critic`, `aesthetic-evaluator` — may only write to their agent-memory dir or review reports.

### Team operation

- Topology follows the owning domain's risk policy. The Project Manager forms a team only when that policy requires one, appoints domain leads, and handles staffing and user/session proxies. Each selected lead gathers teammate advice, decomposes its assigned work, owns the domain's implementation decisions, assigns and monitors the pieces across its team, and reconciles delivery. `plugins/essential/hooks/ALLAGENT.md` carries shared operation rules; each owner plugin's `plugins/<owner>/hooks/ALLAGENT.md` carries only its task-to-specialist rows.
- Subagents reply to the assigning teammate's `agent_id`. Roles and configured names are never direct-message addresses. For continuing work they message the best-known teammate directly when they have its ID, ask the main agent to resolve the ID when the teammate is known, and ask the main agent to suggest a warm peer by folder/feature history or spawn a new named teammate only when they cannot identify the owner.
- Subagents proxy deterministic scripted execution through the main agent: they compose the complete launch input, send it through the direct teammate-messaging capability, and wait for the result (see `plugins/essential/references/scripted-execution.md`). Plans authored by a specialist in plan mode flow back to the main agent the same way for presentation.

### Notes

- The copy-install into `~/.claude/agents/` is load-bearing for the hooks: Claude Code honors `hooks`, `permissionMode`, and `mcpServers` frontmatter only for agents in `~/.claude/agents/` / `.claude/agents/` — agents registered via a plugin ignore those fields. Do not convert the roster to plugin-registered agents, or every embedded fence goes dead.
- Installed agent definitions are intentionally single self-contained files even though their canonical source is split. This is why the write fence is embedded verbatim in both fenced critics.
- Standards references in the definitions never use literal installation paths. They name a standard plus its owning plugin, resolved at runtime when that plugin is enabled. A partial enabled roster is valid, so cross-plugin handoffs and context are best-effort when their owner plugin is absent.

## Completion checklist

- The work ID, repository, and authoritative specification source are unambiguous.
- Specification approval names the exact specification content; plan and review track task definitions directly from `state.md`, with reapproval on any change.
- Every stable task ID and edge in `state.md` is accounted for, with no cycle or contradictory parent roll-up (`state-doctor` confirms), and every required executable leaf is `✓ done` with current validity.
- Target-native tests, lint, type checks, and builds pass where applicable.
- Canonical review artifacts have no outstanding findings; approvals carry their full binding tuples.
- Notion reconciliation and verification completed when the specification is Notion-backed.
- Durable docs match delivered behavior; every accepted decision has its completion-gate disposition.
- Acceptance, receipts, and final work-state status are recorded before cleanup.

## Testing

One command validates this repository, with nothing to install: the Vitest command canonicalized in the Validation section of the root `AGENTS.md`.

That single command is the whole gate: alongside the unit tests it enforces the skill policy limits, agent-template stitching, documentation path resolution, and the preserved-Python inventory gate, and CI runs exactly it on Ubuntu and macOS. Hook byte budgets require author review, as listed in AGENTS.md.

These checks require the installed harness CLIs and stay outside the suite:

```bash
claude plugin validate --strict .
grok plugin validate plugins/<p>
```

Each runs against its installed CLI by hand before publishing a manifest change.
