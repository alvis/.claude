# Git Workflow Standards

*Standards for version control, commit messages, and branch management*

## Commit Format

```plaintext
<type>(<scope>): <summary>   # â‰¤72 chars, imperative

<body>

<footer>
```

### Commit Types

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation
- `style` - Formatting (no logic change)
- `refactor` - Code restructuring
- `perf` - Performance improvement
- `test` - Test updates
- `build` - Build system changes
- `ci` - CI/CD changes
- `chore` - Routine tasks/dependencies
- `revert` - Revert previous commit

### Commit Rules

- **Scope**: directory/module (optional)
- **Summary**: Present tense, imperative mood
- **Reference issues**: `(#123)`
- **Footer**: `Closes #123, #456`

### Commit Examples

```bash
# Good commits
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support
fix(api): handle null user in profile endpoint
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(user): add edge case for email validation

# Bad commits
fixed bug
update code
changes
WIP
```

## Branch Naming

Format: `<type>/<scope>/<topic>`

### Examples

- `feat/web-talent/add-job-filter`
- `fix/profile/correct-validation`
- `chore/update-dependencies`
- `docs/api/add-endpoint-examples`

### Rules

- Use lowercase-kebab-case only
- Keep branch names descriptive but concise
- Include scope when relevant
- Delete branches after merge

## Critical Quality Gates

### Pre-commit Requirements

**ðŸ”´ MANDATORY: Run before every commit**

```bash
npm run lint             # Must pass
npm run coverage            # Must pass  
npm run typecheck       # Must pass (if available)
```

### Absolute Prohibitions

- **NEVER use `--no-verify`** - bypasses essential checks
- **NEVER commit failing tests**
- **NEVER commit linting errors**
- **NEVER commit secrets or sensitive data**
- **NEVER commit commented-out code**
- **NEVER commit console.log statements**

## Branching Strategy

### Main Branch Protection

- All changes via pull requests
- Require passing CI checks
- Require code review approval
- Automatically delete merged branches

### Feature Branch Workflow

1. Create feature branch from main
2. Make changes with frequent commits
3. Push branch and create PR
4. Address review feedback
5. Merge via pull request
6. Delete feature branch

### Hotfix Workflow

For critical production fixes:

1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Make minimal fix with tests
3. Create PR with "hotfix" label
4. Fast-track review process
5. Merge and deploy immediately

## Merge Strategies

### Squash and Merge (Preferred)

- Combines all commits into single commit
- Keeps main branch history clean
- Good for feature branches

### Merge Commit

- Preserves individual commits
- Use for important historical context
- Good for release branches

### Rebase and Merge

- Replays commits onto main
- No merge commit created
- Use sparingly for linear history

## Commit Message Best Practices

### Structure

```
feat(user-profile): add avatar upload functionality

- Implement file upload with validation
- Add image processing and resizing
- Update user model with avatar field
- Include comprehensive test coverage

Closes #245
```

### Guidelines

- **Subject line**: 50 chars or less, imperative mood
- **Body**: Wrap at 72 chars, explain WHY not WHAT
- **Footer**: Reference issues and breaking changes

### Good Examples

```bash
fix(auth): prevent token expiration edge case

The JWT validation was not handling the exact expiration
timestamp correctly, causing valid tokens to be rejected
in some timezone configurations.

Fixes #456

refactor(api): extract common validation logic

Move shared validation functions to utils module to
reduce code duplication across multiple endpoints.

- Extract email validation
- Extract phone number validation  
- Add comprehensive test coverage

No breaking changes
```

## Repository Hygiene

### Regular Maintenance

- Delete merged branches weekly
- Review and close stale PRs
- Update dependencies monthly
- Clean up unused files

### Security Practices

- Never commit `.env` files
- Use `.gitignore` properly
- Rotate any accidentally committed secrets
- Regular security audits of dependencies

### Performance Considerations

- Keep repository size reasonable
- Use Git LFS for large files
- Regular garbage collection
- Shallow clones for CI when possible
