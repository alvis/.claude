# Workflow: Verify Service Operation Page Integrity

## üéØ Objective
Systematically validate the completeness, consistency, and technical accuracy of a service operation page in Notion to ensure high-quality documentation and alignment with technical standards.

## üö¶ Prerequisites
- Access to the Notion service operation page
- Familiarity with the service's technical specifications
- Recent version of the service documentation
- Access to relevant constitution standards and reference materials

## üìã Validation Checklist

### 1. Use Case Validation
**Goal**: Confirm that use cases are realistic, comprehensive, and well-defined.

**Validation Steps**:
- [ ] Verify each use case describes a specific, practical scenario
- [ ] Check that use cases cover typical and edge-case interactions
- [ ] Ensure use cases align with the service's primary purpose

**Example Red Flags**:
- Vague or overly generic use cases
- Missing critical interaction scenarios
- Use cases that contradict the service's core functionality

### 2. Requirements Completeness
**Goal**: Ensure all necessary requirements are documented with clarity and precision.

**Validation Steps**:
- [ ] Confirm all functional requirements are explicitly stated
- [ ] Verify non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability) are addressed
- [ ] Check that requirements are specific, measurable, and actionable

**Example Validation Technique**:
```markdown
# Requirement Assessment Checklist
- [ ] Input validation rules specified? ‚úì
- [ ] Performance thresholds defined? ‚úì
- [ ] Error handling mechanisms documented? ‚úì
```

### 3. Pseudo Code Standards Compliance
**Goal**: Validate that any pseudo code follows our established coding conventions and clarity standards.

**Validation Steps**:
- [ ] Check pseudo code for readability
- [ ] Verify logical flow and structure
- [ ] Ensure consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Confirm algorithmic efficiency is considered

**Example Good Pseudo Code**:
```
function processUserRegistration(userData):
    validate(userData)
    if userData.isValid():
        createUser(userData)
        sendWelcomeEmail(userData.email)
    else:
        logValidationError(userData)
```

### 4. Data Operations Consistency
**Goal**: Confirm data handling, transformations, and storage mechanisms are coherent and well-defined.

**Validation Steps**:
- [ ] Review data input/output specifications
- [ ] Verify data transformation logic
- [ ] Check data persistence and retrieval mechanisms
- [ ] Ensure compliance with data governance standards

**Data Operation Check**:
- [ ] Input data types and constraints documented
- [ ] Transformation rules clearly explained
- [ ] Error and edge case handling for data operations

### 5. Requirements Alignment
**Goal**: Ensure requirements are aligned across technical specifications, design documents, and implementation plans.

**Validation Steps**:
- [ ] Cross-reference requirements with architecture diagrams
- [ ] Compare requirements against implementation notes
- [ ] Verify no conflicting or ambiguous requirements exist

**Alignment Matrix**:
```
Requirement ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation
    ‚úì           ‚úì           ‚úì         ‚úì
```

### 6. Permission Alignment
**Goal**: Validate that permission models and access controls are comprehensive and secure.

**Validation Steps**:
- [ ] Document all user roles and their permissions
- [ ] Verify least-privilege principle is followed
- [ ] Check permission granularity and potential escalation paths

**Permission Checklist**:
- [ ] Admin permissions clearly defined
- [ ] User-level access restrictions documented
- [ ] Potential permission conflicts identified

### 7. Code-Requirements Consistency
**Goal**: Ensure documentation perfectly mirrors potential implementation requirements.

**Validation Steps**:
- [ ] Match documented requirements with potential code implementations
- [ ] Validate that requirements can be technically implemented
- [ ] Identify any gaps between requirements and practical implementation

**Consistency Verification**:
```python
def verify_requirement_implementability(requirement):
    # Technical feasibility assessment
    if can_implement(requirement):
        return True
    else:
        log_implementation_challenge(requirement)
```

## üèÅ Reporting Format
When inconsistencies or issues are found, use the following structured reporting template:

```markdown
## Service Operation Integrity Report

### üîç Findings
- **Area Assessed**: [Specific Validation Area]
- **Issue Severity**: [Low/Medium/High]
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the finding
- **Recommended Action**: Specific steps to address the issue
```

## üí° Best Practices
- Involve multiple reviewers for comprehensive validation
- Regularly update the workflow to reflect evolving standards
- Maintain a collaborative, constructive tone in feedback

## üö® Escalation Path
If critical issues are discovered that cannot be resolved within the team:
1. Document the specific concerns
2. Escalate to the service's technical lead
3. Schedule a review meeting to discuss findings

## Standards to Follow

**üî¥ MANDATORY: All standards listed below MUST be followed without exception**

- [API Design Standards](../../standards/backend/api-design.md) - RESTful API patterns and conventions
- [Documentation Guidelines](../../standards/code/documentation.md) - Documentation requirements
- [Testing Standards](../../standards/quality/testing.md) - Test structure and coverage requirements
- [TypeScript Standards](../../standards/code/typescript.md) - Type definitions and patterns
- [Error Handling Standards](../../standards/backend/error-handling.md) - Error response patterns
- [Security Standards](../../standards/backend/security.md) - Security requirements validation
