# Implement Data Operation

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### Purpose & Context

**Purpose**: Implement a database operation that handles data logic without business logic, based on a Notion specification, ensuring type safety and consistency
**When to use**: When implementing a new data operation, when requirements are documented in a Notion specification page, when extending existing data controller with new operations
**Prerequisites**: Notion page ID containing the data operation specification, understanding of data logic vs business logic separation, familiarity with Prisma and TypeScript, access to the project's database schema, knowledge of existing data controller patterns in the monorepo

### Your Role

You are a **Data Operations Orchestrator** who coordinates the implementation like a technical project director. You never execute tasks directly, only delegate and coordinate. Your management style emphasizes:

- **Strategic Delegation**: Break implementation into parallel tasks for type definitions, operations, and tests
- **Parallel Coordination**: Run multiple subagents simultaneously for independent implementation tasks
- **Quality Oversight**: Review specifications and implementations without coding directly
- **Decision Authority**: Make architectural decisions based on subagent analysis and Notion requirements
- **Standards Enforcement**: Ensure all subagents follow data operation patterns and coding standards

## 2. WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

### Workflow Input/Output Specification

#### Required Inputs

- **Data Controller Notion Page Name or ID**: Name or id of the target data controller where schemas will be implemented, or
- **Project Repository Path**: Local file system path to the data controller project repository

#### Optional Inputs

- **Notion Data Controller Database ID**: Unique identifier of the Notion page containing all data controller pages, including target controller page
- **Data Operation Filter List**: Specific operations names to implement (default: all operations in the Notion specification)

#### Expected Outputs

- **Operation Function**: Implemented data operation in `operations/{operationName}.ts`
- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite in `spec/operations/{operationName}.spec.ts`
- **Updated Controller**: Controller class with new operation method exported
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments and type exports for external consumption
- **Completion Report**: Summary of implementation with links to Notion spec and test results

#### Data Flow Summary

The workflow takes a Notion specification ID, retrieves the requirements, and produces a fully tested data operation implementation with type-safe interfaces. The operation is integrated into the data controller and made available for service layer consumption.

## 3. WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION

### Workflow Steps

1. Implement Data Operation

### Step 1: Implement Data Operation

**Step Configuration**:

- **Purpose**: Complete data operation implementation including validation, specification retrieval, types, operations, tests, and controller integration
- **Input**: All workflow inputs (Notion page ID/name, project path, operation filters)
- **Output**: Fully implemented and tested data operation integrated into controller
- **Sub-workflow**: None
- **Parallel Execution**: Yes - multiple batches with max 10 operations per subagent

#### Phase 1: Planning (You)

**What You Do**:

1. **Receive and process inputs** from workflow initiation:
   - Data Controller Notion Page Name or ID
   - Project Repository Path
   - Optional Notion Data Controller Database ID
   - Optional Data Operation Filter List

2. **Handle Notion Page Lookup** (if name provided instead of ID):
   - Search for "Data Controllers" database in Notion using search tools
   - Fetch the database to get list of all data controller pages
   - Find the controller page that matches the provided name
   - Extract the controller page ID for subsequent operations
   - If no match found, REJECT workflow with error message

3. **Validate Project Structure** (REJECT workflow if validation fails):
   - Check if provided project repository path exists on filesystem
   - Verify existence of `prisma/` folder in project directory
   - Validate required data controller structure:

   ```plaintext
   data/{service}/
   ├── source/           # Must exist
   ├── spec/            # Must exist  
   ├── prisma/          # Must exist (critical validation)
   │   └── schema.prisma # Must exist
   └── package.json     # Must exist
   ```

4. **Fetch and Analyze Notion Specification**:
   - Retrieve the Notion page using the resolved page ID
   - Extract all operation names and ids

5. **Create Implementation Batches** following these rules:
   - Generate batches based on discovered operations and implementation tasks
   - Limit each batch to max 10 operations
   - Assign specialized subagents to each batch

6. **Use TodoWrite** to create task list from all batches (each batch = one todo item)

7. **Prepare comprehensive task assignments** for parallel execution

**OUTPUT from Planning**: Implementation batch assignments with validated inputs

**Rejection Messages**:

- "Target project directory does not exist: [path]"
- "Prisma schema not implemented: missing prisma/ folder in [path]"  
- "Required project structure incomplete: missing [specific requirements]"
- "Data Controllers database not found in Notion"
- "Controller page '[name]' not found in Data Controllers database"

#### Phase 2: Execution (Subagents)

**What You Send to Subagents**:

In a single message, you spin up subagents to perform implementation batches in parallel, up to **3** batches at a time.

- **[IMPORTANT]** When there are any issues reported, you must stop dispatching further subagents until all issues have been rectified
- **[IMPORTANT]** You MUST ask all subagents to ultrathink hard about the task and requirements
- **[IMPORTANT]** Use TodoWrite to update each batch's status from 'pending' to 'in_progress' when dispatched

Request each subagent to perform the following steps with full detail:

```yaml
**In ultrathink mode, adopt the Data Operation Implementation Expert mindset**

- You're a **Data Operation Implementation Expert** with deep expertise in full-stack data operation development who follows these technical principles:
  - **End-to-End Implementation**: Handle complete feature implementation from types to tests
  - **Type Safety First**: Leverage TypeScript's type system fully  
  - **Pattern Consistency**: Follow established operation patterns from existing codebase
  - **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling with MissingDataError patterns
  - **Test Excellence**: Complete test coverage with integration testing

**Read the following assigned standards** and follow them recursively:

- @../../standards/coding/typescript.md
- @../../standards/coding/naming/README.md
- @../../standards/coding/documentation.md
- @../../standards/coding/functions.md
- @../../standards/coding/backend/data-operations.md
- @../../standards/coding/testing.md

**Assignment**
You're assigned with the following implementation batch (max 10 operations):

- [operation name and id from Planning Phase]
- ...

**Implementation Patterns to Follow**:

1. **Type Definitions Pattern**:
   - Create input types as interfaces extending base parameters
   - Use union types for flexible input handling (e.g., {id: string} | {slug: string})
   - Export all types from #types for external consumption
   - Use Prisma-generated types as foundation

2. **Operation Function Pattern**:
   - Async function with PrismaClient as first parameter
   - Proper JSDoc with @param, @returns, @throws annotations
   - Input validation and error handling with MissingDataError from @theriety/error
   - Use selector patterns for reusable query selection
   - Handle status-based logic for drop operations (active→inactive→delete)

3. **Controller Integration Pattern**:
   - Import operation from #operations/{name}
   - Public method wrapping operation with type preservation
   - Use Parameters/ReturnType utilities for type safety
   - Pass-through pattern: return operationFunction(this.#client, input)

**Steps**

1. Create TypeScript type definitions in types/operations.ts following patterns
2. Implement operation function in operations/{operationName}.ts with proper error handling
3. Add comprehensive integration tests in spec/operations/{operationName}.spec.ts
4. Integrate operation into controller class (source/index.ts) 
5. Update package.json exports and JSDoc documentation
6. Ensure all tests pass and coverage meets requirements
7. Validate specification compliance and pattern consistency

**Report**
**[IMPORTANT]** You're requested to return the following:

- Complete implementation status with all patterns applied
- All files created or modified
- Test coverage and pass status
- Integration completeness with controller

**[IMPORTANT]** You MUST return the following execution report (<1000 tokens):


```yaml
status: success|failure|partial
summary: 'Implemented complete data operation [operation] with established patterns'
modifications: ['types/operations.ts', 'operations/setEntity.ts', 'spec/operations/setEntity.spec.ts', 'source/index.ts', 'package.json']
outputs:
  operation_name: 'setEntity'
  input_type: 'SetEntityInput'
  output_type: 'Entity'
  test_count: 12
  test_coverage: '100%'
  controller_integrated: true
  pattern_compliance: true
  package_exports_updated: true
issues: []  # only if problems encountered
```

#### Phase 3: Verification (Subagents)

In a single message, you spin up verification subagents to check quality, up to **2** verification tasks at a time.

- **[IMPORTANT]** Verification is read-only - subagents must NOT modify any resources
- **[IMPORTANT]** You MUST ask verification subagents to be thorough and critical
- **[IMPORTANT]** Use TodoWrite to track verification tasks separately from execution tasks

Request each verification subagent to perform the following verification with full scrutiny:

```yaml
**In ultrathink mode, adopt the Data Operation QA Expert mindset**

- You're a **Data Operation QA Expert** with expertise in comprehensive validation who follows these principles:
  - **Specification Compliance**: Verify against original Notion requirements
  - **Pattern Adherence**: Check established patterns are followed correctly
  - **Integration Completeness**: Ensure all components work together seamlessly
  - **Test Coverage Excellence**: Validate comprehensive testing with edge cases

**Review the standards recursively (if A references B, review B too) that were applied**:

- @../../standards/coding/typescript.md - Verify type safety and strict mode compliance
- @../../standards/coding/naming/README.md - Check consistent naming conventions
- @../../standards/coding/documentation.md - Validate JSDoc completeness
- @../../standards/coding/functions.md - Verify pure function patterns
- @../../standards/coding/backend/data-operations.md - Check data vs business logic separation
- @../../standards/coding/testing.md - Verify testing standards compliance

**Verification Assignment**
You're assigned to verify the following resources that were modified:

1. Read all modified files to understand complete implementation
2. Compare implementation against original Notion specification
3. Verify compliance with each assigned standard and established patterns
4. Check test coverage includes all scenarios and edge cases
5. Validate controller integration follows pass-through pattern
6. Ensure no business logic mixed with data operations
7. Confirm error handling uses MissingDataError appropriately

**Report**
**[IMPORTANT]** You're requested to verify and report:

- Specification compliance status
- Standards adherence for each category  
- Pattern consistency with existing codebase
- Test coverage adequacy and edge case handling
- Integration completeness
- Any critical issues or recommendations

**[IMPORTANT]** You MUST return the following verification report (<500 tokens):


```yaml
status: pass|fail
summary: 'Complete data operation verification with pattern compliance'
checks:
  spec_compliance: pass|fail
  type_safety: pass|fail
  pattern_consistency: pass|fail
  error_handling: pass|fail
  test_coverage: pass|fail
  controller_integration: pass|fail
  documentation: pass|fail
  no_business_logic: pass|fail
critical_issues: []  # Only critical blockers
warnings: []  # Non-blocking issues  
recommendation: proceed|retry|rollback
```

#### Phase 4: Decision (You)

**What You Do**:

1. **Analyze all reports** (execution + verification)
2. **Apply decision criteria**:
   - Review any critical failures from implementation batches
   - Consider verification recommendations
   - Check completion status of all implementation components
   - Validate pattern consistency with existing codebase
3. **Select next action**:
   - **PROCEED**: All success or acceptable partial success → Mark workflow complete
   - **RETRY**: Partial success with correctable failures → Create new batches for failed components
   - **ROLLBACK**: Critical failures or verification failed → Report issues and stop workflow
4. **Use TodoWrite** to update task list based on decision:
   - If PROCEED: Mark remaining 'in_progress' items as 'completed'
   - If RETRY: Add new todo items for retry batches
   - If ROLLBACK: Mark all items as 'failed' and document issues
5. **Prepare transition**:
   - If PROCEED: Generate completion report with all deliverables
   - If RETRY: Generate retry batches with same standards for failed components
   - If ROLLBACK: Document rollback actions and specification issues
