# Workflows Directory

**Purpose**: Comprehensive collection of step-by-step processes for common development tasks, organized by role and responsibility. Each workflow provides detailed orchestration instructions following Claude's delegation model with 5-phase execution patterns.

**When to use**: Reference this directory when you need to execute specific development tasks, understand workflow dependencies, or find the appropriate process for your current role and objectives.

**How workflows operate**: All workflows follow Claude's orchestration model where Claude acts as project director, delegating tasks to specialized subagents and making decisions based on their reports. Each workflow step follows a 5-phase pattern: Planning ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Verification ‚Üí Decision.

## How to Use Workflows

### 1. **Select Your Role**

Choose the section that matches your primary role or the task you're performing.

### 2. **Find the Right Workflow**

Look for the workflow that matches your current task or goal.

### 3. **Follow the Steps**

Each workflow provides:

- **Purpose** - What the workflow accomplishes
- **When to use** - Situational guidance
- **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
- **Detailed steps** - Step-by-step instructions
- **Quality gates** - Required checks and validations
- **Standards references** - Links to related standards

### 4. **Reference Standards**

Workflows link to relevant standards documents for detailed technical requirements.

## Workflow Architecture Principles

### Claude Orchestration Model

- **Strategic Delegation**: Claude breaks complex tasks into parallel subtasks assigned to specialized subagents
- **Quality Oversight**: Claude reviews all subagent outputs without executing tasks directly
- **Decision Authority**: Claude makes go/no-go decisions based on subagent reports and verification results
- **Standards Enforcement**: All workflows require adherence to comprehensive coding and quality standards

### 5-Phase Execution Pattern

Each workflow step follows this consistent pattern:

1. **Planning** - Claude analyzes requirements and creates task assignments
2. **Execution** - Specialized subagents perform assigned work in parallel when possible
3. **Review** - Claude collects and analyzes execution reports
4. **Verification** - Independent verification subagents check quality when needed
5. **Decision** - Claude decides to proceed, retry, or rollback based on criteria

### Workflow Quality Standards

- **Completeness**: Each workflow includes all necessary steps from start to finish
- **Repeatability**: Workflows produce consistent results when followed by different teams
- **Parallel Efficiency**: Independent tasks execute simultaneously to maximize productivity
- **Quality Gates**: Comprehensive verification ensures standards compliance before proceeding

## Need Help?

- **Can't find the right workflow?** Check the [Standards](@../standards/) directory for technical requirements
- **Looking for examples?** See the [Patterns](@../patterns/) directory for templates and examples
- **Need quick reference?** Check the [References](@../references/) directory for lookup information
- **Workflow unclear?** Refer to linked standards documents for detailed technical guidance

## Contributing to Workflows

When updating workflows:

1. **Keep them focused** - One clear purpose per workflow
2. **Make steps actionable** - Each step should be concrete and executable
3. **Include quality gates** - Define what success looks like
4. **Link to standards** - Reference detailed technical requirements
5. **Test the workflow** - Ensure it produces the expected outcome

Remember: Workflows are the "HOW" - they tell you the process to follow. Standards are the "WHAT" - they define the technical requirements and rules.
