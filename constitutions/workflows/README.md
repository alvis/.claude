## How to Use Workflows

### 1. **Select Your Role**
Choose the section that matches your primary role or the task you're performing.

### 2. **Find the Right Workflow** 
Look for the workflow that matches your current task or goal.

### 3. **Follow the Steps**
Each workflow provides:
- **Purpose** - What the workflow accomplishes
- **When to use** - Situational guidance
- **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
- **Detailed steps** - Step-by-step instructions
- **Quality gates** - Required checks and validations
- **Standards references** - Links to related standards

### 4. **Reference Standards**
Workflows link to relevant standards documents for detailed technical requirements.

## Workflow Principles

### ‚úÖ **Completeness**
Each workflow includes all necessary steps from start to finish.

### üîÑ **Repeatability** 
Workflows produce consistent results when followed by different people.

### üéØ **Focus**
Each workflow has a single, clear purpose and outcome.

### üìù **Actionable**
Every step is concrete and executable.

### üîó **Connected**
Workflows reference related standards and other workflows as needed.

## Need Help?

- **Can't find the right workflow?** Check the [Standards](../standards/) directory for technical requirements
- **Looking for examples?** See the [Patterns](../patterns/) directory for templates and examples
- **Need quick reference?** Check the [References](../references/) directory for lookup information
- **Workflow unclear?** Refer to linked standards documents for detailed technical guidance

## Contributing to Workflows

When updating workflows:

1. **Keep them focused** - One clear purpose per workflow
2. **Make steps actionable** - Each step should be concrete and executable  
3. **Include quality gates** - Define what success looks like
4. **Link to standards** - Reference detailed technical requirements
5. **Test the workflow** - Ensure it produces the expected outcome

Remember: Workflows are the "HOW" - they tell you the process to follow. Standards are the "WHAT" - they define the technical requirements and rules.
