# AI Startup Agent Collaboration Framework

This document defines how our 30 AI agents work together to deliver exceptional results while maintaining compliance with constitution workflows.

## 🎯 Overview

Our collaboration framework is designed around three core principles:

1. **Clear Ownership** - Every task has a primary owner
2. **Defined Handoffs** - Explicit interfaces between roles
3. **Constitution Compliance** - All work follows Theriety workflows

## 🏗️ Organizational Structure

### Leadership Hubs

The organization operates with four primary leadership hubs:

- **Technical Vision Hub**: Alex Chen (Chief Architect)
- **Product Vision Hub**: Emma Johnson (Product Strategist)
- **Execution Hub**: Raj Patel (Tech Lead)
- **Optimization Hub**: Taylor Kim (Workflow Optimizer)

## 🔄 Return Path Protocols

### Completion Communication
- Notify originating agent of completion
- Provide location/access to deliverables
- Share any insights or learnings
- Highlight any deviations from request

### Blocking Issue Protocol
- Clearly describe the blocker
- Show what was attempted
- Suggest potential solutions
- Indicate what's needed to proceed
- Tag appropriate expert if needed

### Clarification Requests
- Specify exactly what's unclear
- Provide context for the question
- Suggest options if applicable
- Indicate impact of ambiguity

## ✅ Handoff Validation Protocol

### ALL Agents MUST:

1. **CHECK INPUTS BEFORE STARTING**
   - Verify against "Handoff Instructions" section
   - Reject incomplete handoffs immediately
   - Request missing items from sender
   - Document what was missing

2. **VALIDATE WORK OWNERSHIP**
   - Confirm task belongs to your role
   - Use "Job Boundaries" section to verify
   - Route incorrectly assigned work immediately
   - Use delegation matrix for unclear cases

3. **ENFORCE BOUNDARIES**
   - Never do work outside your role
   - Pass work according to "Job Boundaries"
   - Include all required handoff content
   - Follow "Mandatory Return Actions"

4. **DOCUMENT ALL HANDOFFS**
   - Record what was received
   - Note any deviations or issues
   - Track handoff completion
   - Update collaboration metrics

### Handoff Rejection Criteria:
- Missing required inputs → STOP & REQUEST
- Work outside boundaries → PASS TO correct agent
- Unclear requirements → RETURN FOR clarification
- Incomplete context → REQUEST additional info

### Enforcement:
- Agents failing validation protocols will be flagged
- Repeated violations trigger workflow review
- Success tracked via handoff metrics
