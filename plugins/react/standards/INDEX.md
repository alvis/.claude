# React standards index

Select applicable standards for React work from the table below. The protocol that governs selection, scanning, and rule lookup is `essential:directions/standards.md`; this file only says which standard applies. React declares no other framework or design plugin as a dependency; do not select standards from one.

| Applies to | Standard |
| --- | --- |
| Components and props | `react:standards/components/`, `react:standards/accessibility/`, `react:standards/storybook/`, `react:standards/project-structure/`, and `coding:standards/file-structure/` |
| Hooks | `react:standards/hooks/` |
| Screen-reader, keyboard, and contrast behavior | `react:standards/accessibility/` plus `coding:standards/universal/` and `coding:standards/documentation/` |
| Placement and promotion | `react:standards/project-structure/` plus `coding:standards/file-structure/`; component placement also selects `react:standards/components/` |
| Stories | `react:standards/storybook/` plus `react:standards/components/` |
| All React implementation | `coding:standards/universal/`, `coding:standards/function/`, `coding:standards/typescript/`, `coding:standards/naming/`, `coding:standards/testing/`, and `coding:standards/documentation/` |
| Files and project setup | `coding:standards/file-structure/` |
| Review | `coding:standards/code-review/` plus the React standards above |
| Rendered PR messages and implementation-diff size or composition | `coding:standards/git/` |

Selecting a `coding:` standard requires the coding plugin to be enabled.
