# React Standards Router

Load only the React standards relevant to the current work and route the work itself to its owning skill. This skill supplies context; it does not create implementation teams or duplicate another skill's workflow.

## Boundaries

- Use for: selecting and loading React standards when React work happens — editing `.tsx`/`.jsx` files, building components, authoring `use*` hooks, or writing Storybook stories — and routing enforcement, implementation, and review to their owning skills.
- Do not use for: mechanical lint execution (`react:lint`), implementation (`coding:write-code`), semantic review (`coding:review-code`), or work with no React surface such as backend, CLI, or build configuration.

## Inputs

- **Required**: the files or task at hand, enough to identify which React surfaces are touched (components, hooks, stories, structure, theming).

## Standards

Select every applicable standard from [the React standards index](../../standards/INDEX.md), then apply the selection under [the shared standards protocol](../../../essential/directions/standards.md). These are the sole selection and application contracts for this router.

## Workflow

1. Identify the surfaces the task touches and follow the linked index and protocol to select and apply their standards.
2. Route the work itself:
   - Mechanical enforcement across one or more eligible files: `react:lint` — never route React linting through generic lint first.
   - Feature or bug implementation: `coding:write-code` with the applicable React standards.
   - Generic semantic review: `coding:review-code` with the applicable React standards.
   - Visual design, theming, or runtime diagnosis: recommend an optional web skill when available and hand the work to its owner; otherwise state the recommendation without invoking it.
3. After any task builds or changes a component, route rendered verification before reporting completion:
   - Use the project's Storybook workflow when Storybook is available. If it is unavailable, use another repeatable rendered surface or isolated harness; recommend an available rendered-interface evaluator without making this router depend on another plugin. Keep component fixes with the implementation owner.
   - Write a component/state matrix from the public behavior and accessibility contract. Each row names the component, action or state, expected observable result, surface, viewport/theme (or `N/A` with a reason), and evidence path. Include applicable actions and states such as click or tap, hover, focus-visible, keyboard navigation, input or selection, disabled, loading, error, responsive, and theme behavior. A row is required when the task, public API, or accessibility contract exposes its action/state; mark unexposed actions/states and irrelevant viewport/theme combinations `N/A` with a reason. Optional addon diagnostics are not required unless the task acceptance criteria require them.
   - Execute every row on the selected story, route, or harness. A missing route/tool, failed required interaction, or unavailable required screenshot is `blocked`. A web-owner `partial` result is acceptable only when every required row and screenshot passes and only optional coverage is absent; record that limitation. Otherwise `partial` and `blocked` are incomplete: report the next action and do not report the component build complete.
   - Capture and inspect one screenshot for each changed component and each applicable visual state, including states exercised by the matrix. Record the matrix, executed interactions, expected/observed results, screenshot paths, selected surface, exact revision, and `success`/`partial`/`blocked` result in the implementation or review report. Preserve web-owner raw artifacts at their canonical paths and link to the selected web owner's canonical report/artifact paths instead of copying them.
4. When a scan or review flags a violation code, apply or route the fix under `essential:directions/standards.md`. Repeat until every flagged code is resolved or a concrete blocker remains, then report the blocker instead of looping.

## Verification

- Every touched surface has every standard selected for it by the React index.
- Every flagged violation code was either re-scanned clean, routed to its owning skill, or reported as blocked.
- Optional Web work is recommended and handed to its owner when the task includes visual design, theming, or runtime diagnosis.

## Completion

Report the standards loaded, violation codes flagged and their resolution (fixed, routed, or blocked), routing decisions made, and any optional Web recommendation or handoff.
