# Update Screen Design

Update selected existing screen contracts while separating Notion transport,
temporary work reasoning, and durable design documentation.

## Boundaries and inputs

- Require an explicit bounded selector/product or `--all`; omission never means
  all. Missing pages route to create. For a direct run, run Essential's
  workspace resolver with `--work-id` only for an explicit user override and
  accept its deterministic environment, Git-branch/jj-workspace, or
  sole-existing-work match. Ask only on `work_id_required`, using the returned
  candidates; a delegated run receives the explicit id/root.
- Preserve approved content, alternatives, relations, attachments, links,
  responsive/accessibility decisions, and stable Notion identity.
- Temporary detail belongs under the active work's `design/` with PM-owned
  `design.md`; durable detail belongs under `docs/design/`. Never create a root
  design artifact or edit the canonical template.
- MDC is transport-owned and authorable only through the user/project-selected
  MDC-aware mechanism.

Canonical template/parent/collection ids remain `4555730e74b44592b77dd8a97620d3f2`,
`110161382ea64eefa46a4907574d4530`, and
`c7bc479b-71db-41b1-b5ab-a07c641816b5`.

## Workflow

1. Before creating or materially rewriting a project artifact, read the
   absolute `engineering-work.md` path injected by Essential. If unavailable,
   stop artifact writes and report the missing contract. Use the workspace
   resolver result as the active work root. Read only the work pointers and
   spec/design sources required for the selected screens.
2. Materialize required product/spec context from the source, location, and
   direction supplied by the user or active work state. Use local or inline
   context directly. For a remote source, use the Notion transport/MDC mechanism
   selected by the user or project. Never assume a synchronization skill, a
   default mirror, or a fixed transport directory. Pull the canonical template
   and selected screen tree into the explicitly selected transport root,
   preserve returned `.mdc` paths, and identify pages by `ref:`, never filename.
3. Resolve and record the exact selection before mutation. Map each ref to
   product relation, requested change, source revision/hash, and existing
   durable design path. Block missing/duplicate identity or incomplete pulls.
4. Build a section-preservation map and a lowercase work-local design child for
   each meaningful revision. Integrate only requested/template changes while
   retaining substantive content; present material alternatives/decisions for
   approval. Return index/status rows to the PM rather than editing
   `design.md`/`state.md`.
5. Apply approved Notion body edits through the selected MDC-aware mechanism,
   then use the selected transport for diff, push/conflict handling, and a
   verification pull into an explicit location. Stop the batch on auth,
   conflict, identity, or uncertain remote state; never retry blindly.
6. Regenerate the approved durable `docs/design/<slug>.md` derivation with
   stable Notion ids, source revision/hash, decision/supersession links, and
   current behavior. Promote only system-wide rules to `docs/design/system.md`
   and link rather than duplicate them. Maintain `docs/index.md` links.
7. Reverify requested change, preservation map, relations, responsive states,
   accessibility, remote identity, and durable derivation. Confirm no
   unselected page changed.
8. Return explicit final paths generated or materially rewritten as
`generated_files`, plus PM reconciliation. Do not run file sizing; the PM
checks only eligible work Markdown inside the target `.engineering/`.

## Verification

- Every selected changed page retains one stable ref and verified canonical
  relations; unchanged/unselected pages were not pushed.
- Requested/template changes landed without losing mapped approved content.
- Temporary and durable designs use correct lowercase paths/provenance;
  system-wide rules are single-owned.
- No MDC was hand-written, PM-owned files were not edited, and the
  manifest is complete.

## Completion

Return status, selector, canonical ids, source manifest, changed/compliant/
failed pages, preservation/remote verification, durable/system promotion, PM
reconciliation, recovery actions, and `generated_files`.
