# Create Screen Design

Create new screen design without conflating ignored Notion transport,
task-specific design exploration, and durable versioned design knowledge.

## Boundaries

- Use for new UX contracts, layouts, responsive behavior, interaction states,
  accessibility, and handoff notes. Existing pages route to
  `update-screen-design`; implementation/rendered review stays with Web owners.
- Temporary detail lives in
  `.engineering/works/<work-id>/design/<slug>.md`; `design.md` is the
  PM-owned overview. Do not create an independent design artifact elsewhere.
- Notion-backed `.mdc` paths are owned by the selected transport and authored
  only through the user/project-selected MDC-aware mechanism; do not
  choose/derive filenames or size-gate MDC.
- Durable feature/screen design promotes to `docs/design/<slug>.md`; only truly
  system-wide tokens/components/states/motion/accessibility update
  `docs/design/system.md` or its children.

## Inputs

- **Required**: product and screen descriptions.
- **Optional**: work id, constraints, platforms (default web + mobile), and an
  explicit context source, materialization direction, and local transport root.
- **Prerequisites**: resolvable product/context, Notion credentials/tooling,
  and an active engineering work item.

For a direct run, run Essential's workspace resolver, passing `--work-id` only
when the user supplied an explicit override. Accept its deterministic
environment, Git-branch/jj-workspace, or sole-existing-work match. Ask the user
only when it returns `work_id_required`, using its returned candidates; never
invent an id. A delegated run receives the explicit work id and root.

The canonical template, parent database, and collection remain:

- template `4555730e74b44592b77dd8a97620d3f2`
- parent `110161382ea64eefa46a4907574d4530`
- collection `c7bc479b-71db-41b1-b5ab-a07c641816b5`

## Workflow

1. Before creating or materially rewriting a project artifact, read the
   absolute `engineering-work.md` path injected by Essential. If unavailable,
   stop artifact writes and report the missing contract. Use the workspace
   resolver result as the active work root. Read only the work pointers and
   spec/design sources required for this screen-design assignment.
2. Materialize required product/spec context from the source, location, and
   direction supplied by the user or active work state. Use local or inline
   context directly. For a remote source, use the Notion transport/MDC mechanism
   selected by the user or project and preserve every returned path and ref.
   Never assume a synchronization skill, a default mirror, or a fixed transport
   directory. Pull the live screen template into the explicitly selected
   transport root. Search for collisions; existing screens route to update.
3. Map each requested screen to product relation, source refs, constraints, and
   platform coverage. Create a lowercase work-local design child with purpose,
   audience/task, hierarchy/navigation, responsive behavior, loading/empty/
   error states, accessibility, distinct alternatives/rationale, decisions,
   implementation notes, and provenance.
4. Present alternatives and obtain approval. Return the child row/status to the
   PM for `design.md`/`state.md` reconciliation; do not edit those overview
   files directly.
5. For each approved screen, require an explicit local unsynced MDC path from
   the caller or selected transport; never synthesize it from the title or id.
   Use the selected MDC-aware authoring mechanism to apply the live template,
   body, properties, relations, and canonical `parent` metadata at that path.
   Then run the selected transport in local-to-Notion direction. The transport
   creates the page and writes its stable `ref:` back to the same file. Verify
   the persisted ref and remote identity before attempting another screen.
6. Promote stable non-system design to `docs/design/<screen-slug>.md` with
   Notion ids, source revision/hash, approved decision links, and supersession
   metadata. Route any system-wide rules to `docs/design/system.md` without
   duplicating them in the screen doc. Update `docs/index.md`/design links when
   needed.
7. Verify each remote page through the selected transport's diff or verification
   pull into an explicit verification location, and verify the durable
   derivation against that source. Stop on uncertain creation to avoid
   duplicates.
8. Return explicit final paths generated or materially rewritten as
`generated_files`, plus PM reconciliation. Do not run file sizing; after all
writers finish, the PM checks only eligible work Markdown inside the target
`.engineering/`.

## Verification

- Each screen has one unambiguous remote ref with canonical parent/product
  relations and complete responsive/state/accessibility coverage.
- Work design remains temporary and lower-case; durable promotion is approved,
  versioned, linked, and provenance-backed.
- No MDC path was invented or edited outside the selected MDC-aware mechanism;
  no worker edited PM-owned files.
- `generated_files` includes every work/durable/transport path changed.

## Completion

Return status, canonical ids, work/spec sources, per-screen temporary design,
remote ref/verification, durable promotion/system-rule routing, PM
reconciliation, unattempted recovery, and `generated_files`.
