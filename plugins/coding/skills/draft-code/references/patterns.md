# Drafting Patterns

Canonical placeholder forms and skeleton examples for `coding:draft-code`. These exact forms are the handoff contract: `coding:complete-code` claims only the production markers below, and `coding:complete-test` claims only the test placeholders below. Ambiguous plain `TODO:` markers are claimable by neither.

## Production markers

- Mark every incomplete code section with `// TODO(implementation): <explicit production behavior>` — state the exact behavior to implement, never a vague reminder.
- Where a value is expected (non-void return) or the body would otherwise be empty, throw the sentinel:

  ```typescript
  throw new Error('IMPLEMENTATION: <what is missing>, requiring <parameters as JSON object>');
  ```

  This satisfies the declared return type and avoids unused-variable complaints while keeping the stub loudly incomplete at runtime. Example:

  ```typescript
  throw new Error(
    `IMPLEMENTATION: user authentication logic needed, requiring ${JSON.stringify({ userId, token })}`,
  );
  ```

- Add `TODO(implementation):` comments for deferred validation logic inside type guards or constructors as well — types ship complete, behavior does not.

## Test placeholders

- Use `describe.todo()` / `it.todo()` while no callable runtime entrypoint exists. They mark planned behavior as pending and are completed later by `coding:complete-test`.
- Once a public runtime stub is callable, write the smallest test that invokes it and fails on missing behavior.
- When the contract promises compiler-observable behavior permitted by `TST-CORE-10`, use the project's configured type-test mechanism for the smallest representative consumer case. An acceptance case compiles successfully; a rejection case uses the mechanism's expected-diagnostic convention; overload resolution uses a representative call; narrowing uses a representative predicate/assertion call and its continuation; and a transformation compares representative consumer inputs and outputs. Without the expected-diagnostic convention, leave a rejection case pending or isolate it outside the normal compilation graph until it can run without making type diagnostics fail.
- Do not enumerate type/interface members, exact signatures, schema fields, export inventories, or barrel layout. Declaration shape alone receives no test scaffold; type diagnostics and affected-consumer builds validate it.
- Name unit test files `*.spec.ts`. A suite scoped to a function uses `describe('fn:functionName', ...)`; every case begins `it('should ...', ...)`.
- Structure suites as one describe block per behavior, prepared for the arrange-act-assert pattern, with planned cases covering all functionality.
- Draft supporting test utilities only as far as the scaffold needs: mock factories, fixture templates, and shared helpers.

The skeleton phase is not a publication slice. Public shape, its first implementation, and the focused runtime or compiler-semantic tests its promises require ship as one feature surface.

## Examples

Draft a new service:

```bash
/draft-code "Create user authentication service with login, logout, and token refresh"
# Creates:
# - src/services/auth/types.ts (interfaces)
# - src/services/auth/auth.service.ts (stubs)
# - src/services/auth/auth.spec.ts (runtime-behavior test structure)
```

Draft an API endpoint:

```bash
/draft-code "REST endpoint for product CRUD operations"
# Creates skeleton for controller, service, and tests
```

Draft a utility module:

```bash
/draft-code "Date formatting utilities with timezone support"
# Creates type-safe utility functions with TODO(implementation) markers
```

Rejected — instruction too vague:

```bash
/draft-code "thing"
# Error: instruction too vague to derive types
# Suggestion: provide specific requirements like "Create validation helpers for user input"
```
