# Review checklist and finding schema

Load this from the *Review* step of `coding:review-pr`. Evidence rules come from
[the shared review mandates](../../review-code/references/mandates.md); this file
adds what is specific to reviewing a PR diff.

## Depth

Scale reading depth to the size zone: green reviews line by line, yellow leads
with the key areas then goes line by line, red leads with architecture and goes
line-level only where it matters, black says split it before reviewing further.
The zone shapes how you read, never what you may find — nothing downstream can
recover a finding you chose not to make. A black-zone review defers the
line-level pass; it still reports the structural findings that justify the
split, rather than withholding what it already saw.

Selectivity belongs to publication, not detection, and it caps only optional
polish. Publish every P0 through P3 finding you found, however many that is;
ranking decides the order they are read in, never whether they appear. P4 is the
sole capped level — [tone.md](tone.md) publishes the five highest-ranked and
counts the rest in the overall body — so a 2,000-line review of trivia teaches
nothing, while a long list of real defects is the review doing its job.

One finding per problem, at the highest priority that applies. The same mistake in
eight places is one finding on the clearest instance, noting that it applies
throughout.

## Checks worth reading outside the diff for

These are the findings a diff-only reader cannot make, and they are usually the
most valuable ones in the review:

- **Is this the best solution?** Walk the lean ladder in
  [WORKFLOW.md](../../../references/WORKFLOW.md). Search the repository before
  accepting a new helper, type, or constant: a hand-rolled thing that
  `@theriety/core` or the codebase already provides is a finding, and so is an
  abstraction with one caller.
- **Is this the right place?** A correct change in the wrong location is still a
  finding. Watch for a guard repeated at every call site that belongs in the callee,
  validation in a controller that belongs in the domain layer, a constant copied
  locally that belongs in shared constants, and a symptom patched downstream of the
  function that actually produced the bad value. Propose the destination by exact
  path in `alternative`, and explain what moving it buys — usually that the other
  callers get the fix too. Root-cause-versus-symptom placement is P1, because the bug
  stays live everywhere else; ordinary layering misplacement is P2. When the right
  home is a lower PR in the stack, say so and point at `coding:commit --reorder`,
  which owns reparenting; never reshape history from here.
- **Callers of what changed.** Follow a changed signature, return shape, or thrown
  error into its actual call sites. A caller that now receives `undefined`, ignores
  a new error, or breaks on a renamed field is a verified finding — anchor it to the
  changed line that breaks it, and name the call site in the body.
- **Siblings the new file should resemble.** Open the files with the same role in
  the same directory and compare naming, parameter and return shape, error, log,
  retry, and cache behavior. Unexplained divergence from an established local
  pattern is the most common real finding in a PR review.
- **Scope against the stated goal.** The PR title, body, and any resolvable
  goal/spec are the contract. Report what the PR claims but does not do, and what it
  does without claiming — scope creep is a finding, not a bonus.
- **Secrets and trust boundaries the diff introduces.** Any token, credential,
  internal hostname, or widened trust boundary entering the repository in this diff.
- **Docs the change makes wrong.** Read the README, API doc, or example the changed
  surface belongs to, and flag it when the diff contradicts it.

`style` reports only what the candidate scan surfaced plus naming-policy gaps, each
with its rule id. Never run project lint — `coding:lint` owns that.

## Finding schema

Record each finding as:

<report>

```yaml
findings:
  - path: <repo-relative path as it appears in the diff, or null when the finding is about the PR rather than any line>
    line: <line number in the head revision, or null wherever path is null>
    side: RIGHT | LEFT
    start_line: <first line of a multi-line range, or null>
    concern: alignment | correctness | security | quality | testing | docs | style | process
    priority: P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | null
    kind: question | thought | note | chore | praise | null
    body: <the comment text, written per tone.md>
    evidence: <the rule, failure path, or repository precedent it rests on>
    alternative: <exact path this change belongs in instead, or null>
goal_spec_alignment: matches | diverges | skipped_unknown
not_reviewed:
  - path: <path>
    reason: <binary, generated, vendored, deleted, or too large>
```

</report>

- `path` and `line` must come from the changed-line map. A finding rooted in
  unchanged code anchors to the changed line that causes it.
- A finding about the PR itself rather than about any line — the rebase `chore` in
  `tone.md` is the standard case — sets both to null and is posted in the body's
  *Not anchored to a line* section. Null is the only alternative to a real anchor:
  inventing a plausible line to satisfy the schema is how a merge blocker ends up
  attached to code that has nothing to do with it.
- `side` is `RIGHT` for added lines and `LEFT` for removed ones; most findings are
  `RIGHT`. `start_line` opens a multi-line range and must be below `line` on the
  same side — use it when the problem is a block, not a line.
- `priority` is about consequence, not effort: **P0** breaks correctness, security,
  or data integrity; **P1** violates a standard or will cause a real defect; **P2**
  is maintainability or design; **P3** is optional polish; **P4** is trivia. It
  drives the verdict.
- `concern` is what the finding is about. Every value but `process` grades the code;
  `process` is the one that does not, and it exists so a `chore` — which demands a
  step the author owes rather than a change to the diff — has somewhere honest to
  sit. Every `chore` is `process`, and nothing else is.
- `kind` classifies a comment that makes no priority claim: `chore` for a process
  step the author owes before merge, `question` where intent is genuinely unclear,
  `thought` for a non-blocking idea that is explicitly not a request, `note` for a
  fact the author should know, `praise` where the work is genuinely good.
- Exactly one of `priority` and `kind` is non-null. A comment that claims a
  consequence carries a priority; one that does not carries a kind. `tone.md` renders
  a priority as a badge, `chore` as a tag, and every other kind as an emoji, so this
  field decides the marker and no judgement is left at render time.
- `chore` is the one kind that blocks merge, because it demands an action even though
  it grades nothing. An outstanding `chore` drives the verdict exactly as a P0 or P1
  does; every other kind leaves the verdict untouched.
- `evidence` is mandatory. A finding that cannot name the rule it applies or the
  failure it predicts is an opinion, and opinions are not posted.
- `alternative` carries a real path, not a direction. "Move this to the service
  layer" is not actionable; `src/orders/order.service.ts` is. Leave it `null` unless
  a better location was actually found.
- `goal_spec_alignment` is `skipped_unknown` when no goal or spec can be resolved.
  Never infer a goal from the diff and then grade the diff against it.

## When a concern cannot be finished

Name it in the completion report and cap the verdict at `COMMENT` per
[publishing.md](publishing.md). Never present a partial review as complete, and
never fill the gap by dispatching another reviewer.
