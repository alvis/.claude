# GitHub PR Stacks

Use the current upstream skill at
<https://github.com/github/gh-stack/blob/main/skills/gh-stack/SKILL.md>, the
[official documentation](https://gh.io/stacks), and
`gh stack <command> --help` for the latest contract. Load this reference for
every GitHub PR-stack request, regardless of which `coding:pr` route received
it.

For the jj route, consult the current
[bookmark documentation](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/bookmarks/),
[Git comparison for experts](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/git-experts/), and
live `jj git push --help` output before relying on push behavior.

Choose history ownership once. A repository is jj-colocated only when
`git rev-parse HEAD` equals
`jj log -r @- --no-graph -T 'commit_id'`; a missing command, failed command, or
different ID selects the fully supported plain Git route. `coding:pr review`
owns review on both routes.

## Run the requested action

Attempt the requested command or API call directly. Do not run `gh auth status`
or a general extension probe first. Authentication, repository support, and
extension availability are operational failures, not preconditions. Inventory
uses the REST endpoint below and does not inspect, install, or invoke the
extension.

If an attempted `gh stack` action reports that the extension is missing or
offers installation, ask before running:

```bash
gh extension install github/gh-stack
```

Never install implicitly. For every other failure, preserve stderr, stop, and
report the command and unchanged or partial state. Do not convert an auth or API
failure into a speculative setup step.

Agents must select non-interactive forms:

| Action | Agent form | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| inspect | `gh stack view --json` | bare `view` |
| submit | `gh stack submit --auto [--remote <name>]` | bare `submit` |
| checkout | `gh stack checkout <target>` | bare `checkout` |
| initialize | `gh stack init [--base <trunk>] <branch>...` | bare `init` |
| add layer | `gh stack add <branch>` | bare `add` |
| merge | `gh stack merge <target> --yes --merge-method <method>` | interactive merge |

`modify` is an interactive TUI and has no non-interactive restructure form.
An agent may use only `modify --continue` or `modify --abort` for an existing
session; otherwise ask the user to operate the TUI or use the explicit
unstack-and-reinitialize path below.

Set `--remote <name>` on `link`, `push`, `submit`, `sync`, and `rebase` when the
repository has multiple remotes. `checkout` has no remote flag: use configured
remote resolution and stop on the command's actual ambiguity or remote error.

## List or check out

For `/coding:pr stack list`, unconditionally inventory the current repository
through its paginated `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/stacks` REST endpoint. Fetch
every page and retain the JSON for agent decisions. Unlike the checkout chooser,
the REST inventory keeps fully merged and closed stacks returned by the API.

```bash
REPOSITORY=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner') || exit $?
STACKS_JSON=$(gh api --paginate --slurp \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github+json' \
  "repos/$REPOSITORY/stacks?per_page=100") || exit $?
jq '[.[][] | {
  number,
  url,
  base: .base.ref,
  open,
  pullRequests: [.pull_requests[] | {
    number,
    state,
    draft,
    mergedAt: .merged_at,
    head: .head.ref,
    headSha: .head.sha
  }]
}] | sort_by(.number) | reverse' <<<"$STACKS_JSON" || exit $?
```

An empty array is success. A nonzero API status is failure; preserve stderr and
stop.

Bare `gh stack checkout` is a human-only interactive chooser that checks out the
chosen local or remote stack; it is not a non-mutating inventory operation.
Agent checkout is explicit and deterministic: require the caller's stack
number, PR number, PR URL, or locally tracked branch. As plugin safety policy,
run the clean-worktree guard immediately before every agent checkout, including
update and navigation; this is not an upstream CLI precondition:

```bash
WORKTREE_STATUS=$(git status --porcelain) || exit $?
test -z "$WORKTREE_STATUS" || {
  echo 'refusing stack checkout: worktree has uncommitted changes' >&2
  exit 1
}
```

For the preferred selector, then run an explicit
`gh stack checkout <stack-number>`:

```bash
gh stack checkout "$STACK_SELECTOR" || exit $?
git branch --show-current || exit $?
gh stack view --json || exit $?
```

Prefer a stack number from the REST inventory. Resolution tries a
numeric stack number first, then a locally tracked PR, a GitHub PR, and a
local-only branch. A PR URL is accepted. A branch name resolves only against
local stack tracking. Remote checkout may fetch PR branches and create local
tracking branches; verify the selected branch and JSON composition afterward.
If checkout reports that a different local stack already covers those branches,
it cannot force replacement. Report the conflict. Only with explicit approval,
rerun the clean-worktree guard above immediately before removing that local
tracking, then retry the same explicit checkout:

```bash
gh stack unstack --local || exit $?
gh stack checkout "$STACK_SELECTOR" || exit $?
git branch --show-current || exit $?
gh stack view --json || exit $?
```

## Create, extend, and publish

### jj-colocated repositories

All editing, saving, splitting, reordering, and rewriting goes through
`coding:commit`. Rely on jj's automatic descendant rebase and bookmark movement
after an owning change is rewritten. Do not subsequently run the gh-stack
history publication operators over jj-owned history.

Publish all and only affected unmerged bookmarks in one command. Build the
argument list from the explicit bottom-to-top stack map; never infer it from a
prefix or select every bookmark implicitly:

```bash
jj git push --remote "$REMOTE" \
  --bookmark "$BOTTOM_BOOKMARK" \
  --bookmark "$NEXT_BOOKMARK" \
  --bookmark "$TOP_BOOKMARK" || exit $?
```

jj checks each selected bookmark against its last-seen remote state before
updating it, providing force-with-lease-like protection against overwriting a
remote advance; preserve stderr and report partial state on failure. After the
call, verify every remote head, every PR base, every PR's draft state, and
GitHub grouping before continuing.

`gh stack link` is a conditional, additive, no local tracking bridge for PR
creation, grouping, base repair, or membership. It is not routine history
publication. Its branch arguments are pushed non-force and atomically; that is
link behavior, not an atomicity claim about the preceding `jj git push`. Use it
only after the explicit jj push when GitHub stack state is missing or wrong:

A new stack requires at least two branch or PR selectors. To extend an existing
stack, pass its stack number first and then at least one branch or PR selector.

```bash
gh stack link --base "$DESTINATION" --remote "$REMOTE" \
  "$BOTTOM_BOOKMARK" "$NEXT_BOOKMARK" "$TOP_BOOKMARK" || exit $?
```

The command may create missing PRs, repair bases, and add members; its additive
membership behavior never removes members. Omit `--open` to preserve draft
creation. Because it creates
no local tracking, verify grouping through the paginated Stacks REST projection
and verify every PR with `gh pr view`.

### Plain Git repositories

Initialize explicit bottom-to-top branches and add later layers with current
extension commands:

```bash
git config rerere.enabled true || exit $?
gh stack init --base "$DESTINATION" "$BOTTOM" "$NEXT" "$TOP" || exit $?
gh stack add "$NEW_TOP" || exit $?
```

Existing branches are adopted by `init`; missing ones are created, and the last
branch is checked out. Enabling rerere prevents `init` from opening its first-run
confirmation prompt. `add` must run from the current top. Use `coding:commit`
for each layer's plain commit rather than `add -m`/`-A`/`-u`.

For a locally tracked stack, publish with:

```bash
gh stack submit --auto --remote "$REMOTE" || exit $?
gh stack view --json || exit $?
```

`submit --auto` skips the editor and creates new PRs as drafts. Add `--open`
only when ready-for-review state was requested. Submission pushes branches,
creates or updates PRs and their bases, and creates or updates GitHub grouping.
It is non-atomic: a later branch push or PR update can fail after earlier
branches or PRs changed. Preserve the pre-operation remote head and PR map,
then verify every branch, PR base, draft state, and grouping so partial effects
are reported exactly.

## Update and synchronize

### jj-colocated repositories

Put every history update through `coding:commit`. Rely on jj's automatic
descendant rebase and bookmark movement, then republish once through the
explicit affected-unmerged-bookmark batch defined above. Never follow that
publication with gh-stack's rebase, sync, push, or submit operators.

### Plain Git repositories

Run the clean-worktree guard from [List or check out](#list-or-check-out), check
out the earliest unmerged owning layer, put the plain commit there through
`coding:commit`, then propagate it with the extension:

```bash
gh stack checkout "$OWNING_BRANCH" || exit $?
# Invoke /coding:commit for the owning layer before continuing.
gh stack rebase --upstack --remote "$REMOTE" || exit $?
gh stack push --remote "$REMOTE" || exit $?
gh stack view --json || exit $?
```

Use `rebase --downstack` for trunk through the current layer, `--no-trunk` for
inter-layer alignment only, and `--continue` or `--abort` after conflicts.

For full remote reconciliation use:

```bash
gh stack sync --remote "$REMOTE" || exit $?
gh stack view --json || exit $?
```

`sync` fetches, reconciles remote membership, updates trunk, cascade-rebases,
pushes all active branches atomically, refreshes PR state, and links two or more
open PRs. It never creates PRs. Add `--prune` only with explicit approval to
delete local merged branches. It may exit zero after a divergence abort or a
push warning; verify the branch graph, remote head, PR state, and grouping
rather than accepting exit zero as success.

## Restructure or remove grouping

### jj-colocated regrouping

Record the paginated Stacks REST projection, then remove only the remote
grouping with an explicit target:

```bash
gh stack unstack "$STACK_NUMBER" || exit $?
```

Stop and verify the intended remote unstack through the paginated Stacks REST
projection and `gh pr view`. Only after that verification succeeds, use the
conditional additive `gh stack link` bridge from the jj route to recreate or
repair grouping, bases, and membership. Do not initialize local gh-stack
tracking or submit jj-owned history.

### Plain Git regrouping

For a human-operated restructure, `gh stack modify` can drop, fold, insert,
reorder, and rename layers; afterward the agent runs
`gh stack submit --auto [--remote <name>]` to publish the new shape. Agents do
not drive this TUI.

For a deterministic regroup, record `gh stack view --json`, then remove only
the grouping with an explicit target:

```bash
gh stack unstack "$STACK_NUMBER" || exit $?
```

Stop and verify the intended remote unstack through the paginated Stacks REST
projection and `gh pr view`. Only after that verification succeeds, rebuild and
publish the local stack:

```bash
gh stack init --base "$DESTINATION" "$BOTTOM" "$NEXT" "$TOP" || exit $?
gh stack submit --auto --remote "$REMOTE" || exit $?
gh stack view --json || exit $?
```

`gh stack unstack <stack-number>` deletes neither PRs nor branches. A partial
remote unstack leaves merged, merging, or queued PRs—including PRs with
auto-merge enabled—in the remote stack and leaves local tracking unchanged.
`--local` removes only local tracking and preserves GitHub grouping. Verify both
scopes after the call: use the paginated Stacks REST projection and `gh pr view`
for every member, and use `view --json` for local tracking. After
`unstack --local`, verify that the former branch reports no local stack while
the REST projection still contains the remote grouping. Never delete or close a
PR merely to change stack membership.

## Merge and navigate

Use GitHub's atomic stack merge, not `gh pr merge` or the generic bottom-up
loop, for a GitHub PR stack:

```bash
gh stack merge "$STACK_OR_PR_NUMBER" --yes \
  --merge-method "$MERGE_METHOD" || exit $?
```

Bind `MERGE_METHOD` from the caller or repository policy; do not select a
default. The equivalent explicit flags are `--squash`, `--rebase`, or
`--merge`. A PR target merges that PR and every unmerged PR below it; a stack
target merges the whole stack. The operation is all-or-nothing unless a merge
queue accepts the stack, in which case repository queue policy controls
landing.

`gh stack up [n]`, `down [n]`, `top`, `bottom`, and `trunk` are supported
non-interactive navigation commands. For automation, when the destination is
known, run the clean-worktree guard from
[List or check out](#list-or-check-out), then use
`gh stack checkout <exact-branch-or-PR>` followed by `view --json`. Do not use
interactive `gh stack switch`.

## Verify and recover

After every locally tracked mutation, use `gh stack view --json` to confirm
saved local order, current branch, PR URLs, heads, bases, merge state, and
`needsRebase`. Its API refresh is best-effort, so separately use `gh pr view`
to verify remote head SHAs, bases, and draft state. For `link`, remote unstack,
and regrouping, verify grouping through the paginated Stacks REST projection;
`view --json` cannot verify state that has no local tracking.

- Do not trust exit status alone: divergence and push-warning paths can leave
  `sync` at exit zero. Verify post-state.
- `push` and `submit` are non-atomic: they may update earlier branches before a
  later lease fails. Preserve the pre-operation remote head map, report partial
  progress, and retry only after resolving the rejected branch.
- Resolve a rebase conflict, stage files, and run `rebase --continue`, or run
  `rebase --abort`; never leave a partial rebase as success.
- Repository support, authentication, API, ambiguity, lock, and invalid-input
  errors are command failures. Preserve their stderr and stop.
