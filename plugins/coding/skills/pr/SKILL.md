# Pull Requests

When running a `jj` operation, follow `coding:directions/jj.md`; its stacked-review repair route precedes `coding:pr update` publication.

Before any script call, set `CODING_PR_SKILL_DIR` to the absolute directory containing this loaded `SKILL.md`. This works in all three harnesses; not every harness exposes a plugin-root variable to ordinary shell calls.

Route every remote pull-request operation through one explicit subcommand. Local history mutation remains owned by `coding:commit`; local pre-commit review remains owned by `coding:review-code`.

Each action reference owns its directions. Scan each implementation diff and rendered PR body against `coding:standards/git/`. Author PR bodies through [message.md](templates/message.md), then validate them with [scan-pr-message.ts](scripts/scan-pr-message.ts). Render anchored review comments through [inline-review.md](templates/inline-review.md) and the overall verdict through [overall-review.md](templates/overall-review.md).

## Usage

```text
/coding:pr resolve <number-or-pr-url> [--prefer stack|pr]
/coding:pr checkout <number-or-pr-url-or-local-branch> [--prefer stack|pr]
/coding:pr author [<commit-ref>] [--base <ref>]
/coding:pr verify --target <revision-anchor> --base <revision-anchor> [--kind standalone|stack-tip]
/coding:pr create [<commit-ref>] [--branch-prefix <name>] [--remote <name>] [--no-verify] [--max-iteration <count>] [--dry-run]
/coding:pr update [<pr-number-or-url> | <commit-ref>] [--branch-prefix <name>] [--remote <name>] [--no-verify] [--max-iteration <count>] [--dry-run]
/coding:pr review [<pr-number-or-url> | <source-tree-path>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--area=<list>] [--dry-run]
/coding:pr stack list
/coding:pr stack checkout <stack-number-or-pr-number-or-pr-url-or-local-branch>
/coding:pr merge <pr numbers...> [--method=rebase|squash|merge] [--remote <name>] [--destination <branch>] [--force]
```

When the request omits a subcommand, names no clear action, or could select more than one action, print the complete usage block above and stop. Do not infer a remote mutation.

## Routing

PR numbers and stack numbers are separate sequences, so a bare number can name both. Before `resolve`, `checkout`, `update`, `review`, `merge`, or a `stack` selector acts on a number or URL, bind its namespace through [resolve.md](directions/resolve.md), which orders the two lookups by the request's own wording. Never report a number as unlocatable from one namespace's lookup alone.

For every request to create, inspect, update, restructure, publish, check out, sync, navigate, unstack, or merge a GitHub PR stack, load [github-stacks.md](references/github-stacks.md) before selecting an operator. This applies even when the request arrives through `create`, `update`, or `merge`, rather than the explicit `stack` route.

- `resolve` reports which namespace a number or URL names, and mutates nothing. Follow [resolve.md](directions/resolve.md) and report the resolved surface, the rejected candidate, and any ambiguity.
- `checkout` lands a resolved stack or PR in a `jj` workspace. Follow [Land the resolved surface](directions/resolve.md#land-the-resolved-surface), which fetches the resolved head and adds a workspace on it, leaving every existing workspace untouched. It never commits, rewrites, pushes, or publishes.
- `author` writes deterministic PR title and body text without publication, using [message.md](templates/message.md) when the repository has no local template. Follow only [Author the PR text](directions/create-update.md#author-the-pr-text); `--base` selects the intended PR base instead of the first-parent default.
- `verify` runs the fail-closed local test/lint gate for one exact target and base without publishing. Load and follow [verify.md](directions/verify.md); callers must pass resolved immutable revision IDs, and `--kind` defaults to `standalone`. Because these inputs do not identify a base ref or event type, workflow applicability is conservative and the receipt records that mode.
- `create` opens new draft PRs for one saved change or a conventional linear stack. Load and follow [create-update.md](directions/create-update.md) with `ACTION=create`, including its default tip-first and bottom-up local verification gate, and always load [stacked-prs.md](directions/stacked-prs.md).
- `update` republishes existing PR heads for a conventional linear stack, refreshes their title, body, and bases, and drives CI to green. Load and follow [create-update.md](directions/create-update.md) with `ACTION=update`, including its default tip-first and bottom-up local verification gate, and always load [stacked-prs.md](directions/stacked-prs.md).
- `review` publishes one external review per PR, or one holistic review unit for a linear stack with findings attributed to its PR surfaces. As the context-owning caller, load [review.md](directions/review.md), provision any owned tree, and retain its cleanup lease. Run the read-only steps in a fresh `code-quality-critic` subagent with no inherited implementation context, close the lease after any return or cancellation, and never delegate again from that dedicated reviewer. A fresh critic dispatched by [review-loop.md](directions/review-loop.md) with an explicit preprovisioned stack capsule is already that dedicated reviewer: it runs the review phase directly instead of nesting another dispatch.
- `stack` follows [references/github-stacks.md](references/github-stacks.md#list-and-land):
  - `list` lists the current repository's GitHub PR stacks.
  - `checkout <stack-number-or-pr-number-or-pr-url-or-local-branch>` lands one explicitly selected stack, after namespace resolution, in a `jj` workspace at its top member's head. It may fetch, but it does not own commits, history rewriting, pushes, or PR publication.
- `merge` validates and merges a conventional linear stack bottom-up. For a GitHub PR stack, use the GitHub operator map loaded above instead. Otherwise load and follow [stacked-prs.md](directions/stacked-prs.md), then [merge.md](directions/merge.md).

<IMPORTANT>
Execute exactly one subcommand per invocation. A workflow may instruct a later `coding:pr` invocation, but it must name that subcommand explicitly. Reject an option absent from the public usage contract and stop before any remote mutation. The sole internal option is `--publish-only`; accept it only from the owned review-loop or red-CI-repair continuations under [create-update.md](directions/create-update.md), never from a direct caller.
</IMPORTANT>
