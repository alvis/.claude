# Manage Stacked Pull Requests

Load this reference when a create or update target contains multiple dependent
changes, when merge receives more than one PR, or when the caller has not chosen
a PR shape and the review surface may benefit from a stack.

Apply `GIT-PR-SIZE-*`, `GIT-PR-TYPE-02..05`, and `GIT-PR-STACK-04` from
`coding:standards/git/`; this reference owns stack directions and executable
operators.

## Suggest a stack

Calculate the active size zone with the canonical classifier:

```bash
bun run "${CODING_PR_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/classify-pr-size.ts" \
  --repo "$REPO_ROOT" --base "$BASE_OID" --head "$HEAD_OID"
```

Its file count includes every changed path, including generated, vendored, and
binary files. Its authored net LOC excludes additions and deletions from
recognized package lockfiles and paths marked `linguist-generated` at the base
or head. Use the returned zone; do not inspect or reproduce the classifier's
internal threshold data. A green result is the review surface one reader can
hold at once.

Require a split regardless of size or a standalone preference when one PR
violates the composition standard, including migration with logic or
mechanical refactoring with behaviour. Otherwise
respect an explicit standalone-or-stack choice.

When no shape was chosen, proactively suggest a stack when the proposed PR
exceeds the active green zone and its files form at least two domain-coherent
slices that compile, test, and deliver reviewable value in bottom-to-top order
without forward references.

Do not suggest a split based on counts alone. Apply `GIT-PR-TYPE-02`
directly: public shape and prerequisite scaffolding stay with the first
implementation that fulfills or consumes them, even when the atomic feature is
large, while declarations that are themselves complete type-level
implementations, including inside mixed runtime packages, and standalone
runnable or buildable initialization retain that rule's exceptions. Apply
`GIT-PR-TYPE-05` before splitting: prohibited generated output is removed, not
moved to another PR.
Every proposed slice must be
independently valid: non-migratory configuration prerequisites stay with the
first behavior that consumes them, while database migrations, data backfills,
and configuration-format upgrades remain governed by `GIT-PR-TYPE-03`. Add and
consume a feature flag with the changed behavior under `GIT-PR-STACK-04` and
`GIT-PR-TYPE-02`; it is not a prerequisite slice. Keep runtime-behavior tests,
focused compiler-semantic tests permitted by `TST-CORE-10`, and
lockfiles with the change that needs them. When splitting would break integrity
or merely scatter one feature or mechanical operation, keep one PR and apply
its actual size zone.

Present the suggestion before publication:

```text
Suggested stack:
01 <conventional title> — <files or domain>; base: <destination>
02 <conventional title> — <files or domain>; base: <01 head>
...
```

Ask whether to use an optional proposed stack. A declined optional suggestion
proceeds as one PR with its zone-required sections. A mandatory category split
blocks publication until accepted and shaped through `coding:commit`; neither
path silently reshapes history.

## Stack directions

- Shape local history through `coding:commit`; `coding:pr` does not split,
  reorder, amend, or absorb changes.
- Name each non-work-stream head `<feature-slug>/NN-<scope>` with a shared
  kebab-case slug, a zero-padded bottom-to-top ordinal, and a short kebab-case
  slice name. A work stream uses the branch prefix from
  `essential:references/naming.md` and appends only `NN-<scope>`.
- Require one linear chain from the destination through every selected head.
- Open every PR as draft. PR 01 targets the destination; each later PR targets
  the previous head.
- Fix a finding in the earliest unmerged change that owns it. In a `jj` stack,
  use the `jj edit` review-repair route in `coding:directions/jj.md`; once a
  lower PR merges, fix forward instead of rewriting public history.
- Update and merge the complete affected chain bottom-up.

Load [github-stacks.md](../references/github-stacks.md) for every GitHub PR-stack request,
including discovery, checkout, creation, publication, update, navigation,
restructure, unstack, or merge. That reference is the sole owner of GitHub
stack inventory behavior and selects one conditional history owner. A
repository uses jj when `jj git root` resolves its backing Git directory and
that store contains the active workspace's exact `@-` commit object. This
includes registered parallel jj workspaces with no workspace-local `.git`;
route their pre-publication Git configuration and remote reads through the
resolved backing store. Every other result is fully supported plain Git. On the
jj route, `coding:commit` owns history mutation for edit- and fix-induced
rewrites, where jj automatically rebases descendants and moves bookmarks.
Merge-induced descendant topology changes remain owned by `coding:pr merge`.
On the plain Git route, the extension retains its local tracking and native
stack operators.

## Inspect with jj

Before either inspection route, execute the shared authoritative
[REMOTE gate](create-update.md#bind-the-push-remote). Use jj only when it is
functionally colocated with Git. Inspect the candidate chain and bookmark
placement without mutating it:

```bash
jj log -r "<destination>@$REMOTE..<selected-top-change>" --no-graph \
  -T 'change_id.short() ++ " " ++ bookmarks ++ " " ++ description.first_line() ++ "\n"'
jj bookmark list --all
jj log -r '<parent-change> & ::<child-change>' --no-graph -T 'commit_id'
```

For new publication, the containment query uses the selected local change IDs
because remote bookmarks do not exist yet. For an existing stack, repeat it
with `<parent>@$REMOTE` and `<child>@$REMOTE` to verify the published chain. Every
query must return a commit ID for its adjacent pair. If one saved change must be
split, invoke `coding:commit` with the accepted slices. Reserve
`coding:commit --reorder` for an already partitioned chain that needs reordering
or reparenting. After the result is linear, use
`coding:pr create <bottom-change>` for new PRs or
`coding:pr update <bottom-pr-or-head>` for an existing stack. The create/update
workflow owns bookmark placement, leased pushes, PR bases, and the structured
synchronization receipt.

After a lower PR merges, use `coding:pr merge` for the remaining round. Any
merge-induced descendant rebase, bookmark movement, and affected-head batch
publication remain owned by that merge workflow. `coding:commit` owns edit- or
fix-induced rewrites outside the merge operation.

## Inspect with Git

Inspect the candidate chain and branch placement without mutating it:

```bash
git log --reverse --oneline "$REMOTE"/<destination>..<selected-top-ref>
git branch --list '<feature-slug>/*'
git merge-base --is-ancestor <parent-commit> <child-commit>
```

For new publication, use selected local commit IDs. For an existing stack,
repeat the command with `$REMOTE/<parent-head>` and `$REMOTE/<child-head>`.
Every ancestry command must exit zero. If one commit must be split, invoke
`coding:commit` with the accepted slices; use `coding:commit --reorder` only
for an already partitioned chain needing reorder or reparenting. Then use
`coding:pr create <bottom-commit>` for new PRs or
`coding:pr update <bottom-pr-or-head>` for an existing stack. The create/update
workflow owns branch placement, force-with-lease pushes, PR bases, and the
structured synchronization receipt.

After a lower PR merges, use `coding:pr merge` for the remaining round. It
records immutable parent tips and replays only child-exclusive commits with
`git rebase --onto <new-parent> <old-parent-tip> <child>`, then pushes each
remaining head with `--force-with-lease`. Retarget the immediate child's PR to
the destination and verify that base before resuming the next merge round.

## Verify

Before publication and after every stack synchronization, confirm:

- each change is independently green;
- branch/bookmark names and PR bases express the same bottom-to-top chain;
- each remote PR head SHA equals the recorded local SHA;
- no merged revision was rewritten;
- every new PR starts as draft; the review loop promotes only converged approved surfaces to ready for review.

The create/update workflow owns publication and CI convergence; the merge
workflow owns per-round merge and descendant restacking. This reference owns
shape selection and the shared jj/git operator map.
