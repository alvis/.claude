# Verify Exact Local CI Parity

Run the local test and lint commands defined by applicable `pull_request`
workflows for one exact revision surface. This action never publishes or mutates a
remote.

## Inputs

- `TARGET_SHA`: immutable revision ID for the standalone head or selected stack tip.
- `TARGET_BASE`: immutable revision ID for the standalone PR base or selected stack root base.
- `TARGET_KIND`: `standalone` or `stack-tip` for the receipt; defaults to
  `standalone` only for the public `coding:pr verify` action.

Reject unresolved refs, an unknown kind, or an empty input. A changed target,
base, or applicable workflow input invalidates all evidence and restarts the
gate. These inputs intentionally provide neither the pull request's base ref
nor its create/update event type.

## Workflow

Resolve the target repository's main source checkout first:

```bash
SOURCE_REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

Require jj to be installed, initialized for that checkout, and able to resolve
the exact target commit without snapshotting the current working copy:

```bash
command -v jj >/dev/null 2>&1 || exit 42
JJ_TARGET_SHA=$(jj --repository "$SOURCE_REPO_ROOT" --ignore-working-copy \
  log -r "$TARGET_SHA" --no-graph -T 'commit_id' 2>/dev/null) || exit 42
test "$JJ_TARGET_SHA" = "$TARGET_SHA" || exit 42
CI_PARITY_EXECUTION_ENGINE=jj-run
printf 'CI_PARITY_EXECUTION_ENGINE=%s\n' "$CI_PARITY_EXECUTION_ENGINE"
```

Do not initialize or upgrade jj inside this action. Repository initialization,
the 0.44 version floor, and linked Git worktree handling belong to the shared
jj guide and `coding:sync-tool`. Failure to prove them blocks verification;
only create/update's explicit `--no-verify` can bypass its local gate.

Use the source checkout as the repository argument to `jj run` and for
read-only discovery of environment sources such as `.env`, `.env.local`, and
`.env.test`. Load task variables only from user-approved sources, preserve CI's
declared values and precedence, and pass only the task's required environment.
Never copy secret values into reports or execute repository test, lint, setup,
or formatter commands directly in the source checkout.

Create one detached disposable worktree at the target revision through the bundled
helper and verify its revision. It owns workflow and command discovery; do not
execute repository tasks from it:

```bash
TREE_JSON=$(bash "${CODING_PR_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/temp-tree.sh" \
  open-git "$SOURCE_REPO_ROOT" "$TARGET_SHA")
TREE_LEASE=$(jq -er .lease <<<"$TREE_JSON")
TEST_WORKTREE=$(jq -er .tree <<<"$TREE_JSON")
test "$(git -C "$TEST_WORKTREE" rev-parse HEAD)" = "$TARGET_SHA"
```

The context-owning parent passes `TEST_WORKTREE`, `SOURCE_REPO_ROOT`,
the target revision, and the selected execution engine to the tester. It retains
cleanup ownership. On cancellation or blocked discovery it closes the lease
and verifies that its file and VCS registration are gone.

Read `.github/workflows/*.yml` and `.github/workflows/*.yaml` only from
`TEST_WORKTREE`. Set applicability mode to `conservative_pull_request` and
include every workflow triggered by `pull_request`. Do not exclude one because
of `branches`, `branches-ignore`, `types`, `paths`, or `paths-ignore` filters:
bare revision IDs do not carry the complete hosted event context needed to
evaluate those filters reliably. Use `TARGET_BASE..TARGET_SHA` only as the
changed command surface, not to narrow workflow applicability. Follow every
included workflow's repo-local reusable workflows, composite actions, package
scripts, workspace manifests, Makefiles, and task files from the target revision.
Record the exact test and lint `run:` commands in workflow order plus only
their required setup, preserving shell, working directory, matrix values, and
environment. Install necessary tooling and dependencies without asking for
approval, using the target revision's CI setup and package-manager inputs in
the isolated task. Do not substitute a nearby command or invent a check. Record
an exact absence when no included workflow defines test or lint. An unavailable
setup requirement is a setup failure, never evidence that an unattempted test
failed.

For each parsed workflow, apply this decision contract. The parser supplies
`HAS_PULL_REQUEST_TRIGGER` from the workflow's `on` declaration; filter values
are deliberately absent because they cannot change the decision:

```bash
case "$HAS_PULL_REQUEST_TRIGGER" in
  1)
    CI_PARITY_WORKFLOW_DECISION=include
    CI_PARITY_APPLICABILITY_MODE=conservative_pull_request
    CI_PARITY_UNEVALUATED_FILTERS=base_ref,event_type,paths
    ;;
  0)
    CI_PARITY_WORKFLOW_DECISION=exclude
    CI_PARITY_APPLICABILITY_MODE=not_applicable
    CI_PARITY_UNEVALUATED_FILTERS=
    ;;
  *)
    exit 2
    ;;
esac
printf 'CI_PARITY_WORKFLOW_DECISION=%s\n' "$CI_PARITY_WORKFLOW_DECISION"
printf 'CI_PARITY_APPLICABILITY_MODE=%s\n' "$CI_PARITY_APPLICABILITY_MODE"
printf 'CI_PARITY_UNEVALUATED_FILTERS=%s\n' "$CI_PARITY_UNEVALUATED_FILTERS"
```

Inspect CI `env`, `secrets.*`, `vars.*`, and command-level references to
supply available values with the declared precedence. A missing declaration
alone never fails a task or creates a question: attempt the exact command with
the available environment first, without inventing an empty replacement. Record
unavailable names without exposing values. If a supplied non-secret CI value
cannot be reproduced, retain the attempted result but mark parity blocked;
a successful run under different inputs is not exact CI evidence. An unused
unavailable declaration does not invalidate a successful task.

After a command fails, classify it as a missing-variable failure only when its
captured output explicitly names a CI-declared variable it could not obtain.
Validate those names against the selected workflow and command chain, then
close the lease and ask for an explicit source and rerun, or approval for this
exact target revision and exact lexically sorted name list. Missing tools,
dependencies, authentication, and other errors remain ordinary failures; repair
permitted setup and rerun, or report the blocker. Never infer skip approval from
another flag, a declaration, or an earlier revision.

Record expected hosted check/job names from the selected workflows at
`TARGET_SHA` and required branch status checks or rulesets when accessible
through `gh api`; record inaccessible sources instead of assuming they are
empty.

Dispatch one fresh small-model read-only tester. It MUST NOT edit, format,
commit, or push. It first runs the discovered test and lint commands in CI order
at the target revision with the required setup and available environment,
continues through independent commands after failure, and returns under 1000
tokens. Assign a stable nonempty `dependency_group` to every command: commands
whose prerequisites are coupled share a group, while independent commands use
different groups. Keep setup and its dependent command in the same isolated
invocation so `--clean` cannot discard their installed dependencies.

Resolve the workflow's complete shell template, including GitHub Actions'
default flags when `shell` is omitted, into `CI_SHELL_TEMPLATE`. The template
must contain `{0}` for the script path. Execute every discovered test or lint
task with its exact required setup as one shell task through this runner shape:

```bash
CI_TASK_FILE=$(mktemp)
trap 'rm -f "$CI_TASK_FILE"' EXIT
printf '%s\n' "$CI_TASK_SCRIPT" >"$CI_TASK_FILE"
case "$CI_SHELL_TEMPLATE" in *'{0}'*) ;; *) exit 42 ;; esac
CI_SHELL_COMMAND=${CI_SHELL_TEMPLATE//\{0\}/"$CI_TASK_FILE"}
jj --repository "$SOURCE_REPO_ROOT" --ignore-working-copy run \
  --clean --ignore-changes --root -r "$TARGET_SHA" -- \
  bash -c 'exec bash -c "$1"' _ "$CI_SHELL_COMMAND"
```

`CI_SHELL_TEMPLATE` preserves every workflow shell flag and placeholder;
`CI_TASK_SCRIPT` preserves the working directory, matrix values, required
environment and setup, and exact test or lint command. One fresh
`--clean` invocation per task prevents artifacts from another revision or task
from affecting the result; setup and its dependent command stay inside that
same invocation. `--ignore-changes` is mandatory because verification must not
amend the target or rebase descendants. Do not use `--ignore-errors`, which
would hide the task's failing exit status. Continue through other independent
tasks with separate invocations and record each status.

Install project dependencies from the target revision inside each clean task
using its CI package-manager command, lockfile, workspace configuration, and
install scripts. Do not copy an installed dependency tree from another checkout:
its manifests cannot prove which patches or lifecycle inputs produced it.
Package-manager downloads may use their normal content-verified cache; installed
outputs remain disposable and local to the exact target task.

For every task, verify that the runner's `JJ_COMMIT_ID` equals the target revision ID; a
mismatch blocks the gate.

After the first attempt, if and only if its captured failure evidence names
missing CI variables, sort those names into one comma-separated value and set
`MISSING_SECRET_FAILURE_CONFIRMED=true`. Then enforce the stop or exact-
approval decision:

```bash
source "${CODING_PR_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/gate-missing-secrets.sh"
```

When `MISSING_SECRET_FAILURE_CONFIRMED` is unset or false, the helper keeps the
local run pending even if CI declarations or an approval happen to name
variables. With confirmation, `MISSING_SECRET_APPROVED=true`, the exact
`TARGET_SHA`, and the exact lexically sorted `MISSING_SECRET_NAMES` approval
remain required for `approved_without_local_run`.

Treat repository workflows and scripts as untrusted code. Run allowlisted
commands through the selected isolated runner, limit writes to its working copy
and a temporary directory, deny network by default, and remove ambient tokens,
credential helpers, SSH agent sockets, cloud credentials, and unrelated
environment variables. Pass only the minimal toolchain and task-specific environment. Permit network
access needed for the selected tooling/dependency setup; other network access
or credentials require specific authority. Stop when that authority is
unavailable. Never expose the parent session's credentials. The
tester neither removes the discovery worktree nor closes or reports on the
parent-owned `TREE_LEASE`.

Serialize the exact ordered workflow command/result set once as canonical JSON
in `CI_PARITY_EXPECTED_WORKFLOW_COMMAND_RESULTS_JSON`. Every entry records the
target ref, kind, exact command, source, result status, and
`failure_evidence` and a dependency group. A successful attempted command
records integer status `0` and `failure_evidence: null`. When a command exits
nonzero because it could not obtain one or more named CI variables, retain its
numeric shell status and record exactly
`{"type":"missing_ci_variable","names":["<variable name>"]}` as its
`failure_evidence`, with every name declared missing and the array lexically
sorted and unique. An approved receipt must contain at least one such attempted
failure, and the sorted unique union of all evidence names must equal the exact
missing-secret name array. Use `not_run_missing_secret` with
`failure_evidence: null` only for commands genuinely skipped after a qualifying
failure in the same dependency group. Independent groups continue to run and
retain their attempted results. Any other status/evidence pair, including an
ordinary non-secret numeric failure or a non-integral/out-of-range status, blocks
the receipt. Serialize the exact lexically sorted missing-secret-name array as
`CI_PARITY_EXPECTED_MISSING_SECRET_NAMES_JSON`; use `[]` when none are missing.
Embed those exact arrays in the complete JSON receipt below and return all three
values to the caller. Do not return a standalone approval as a substitute for
the receipt.

For an approved receipt, a nonzero attempted result replaces `null` with the
exact `type`/`names` missing-variable evidence object above. A string
`not_run_missing_secret` status remains a genuine skip and must keep
`failure_evidence` null; it is not interchangeable with an attempted numeric
result. Results in one dependency group remain in workflow order; a group enters
skip state only after its own qualifying failure, while an independent group may
continue attempting tasks.

</report>

After consuming the report, the parent closes the retained lease and records
the exact lease, tree, close status, and proof that both the lease file and VCS
registration are gone. A tester result cannot claim parent cleanup. Close the
lease before stopping on cancellation or terminal failure.

On local failure, diagnose captured output without editing and return the root
cause, likely owning change, affected files, exact commands and statuses, and
unresolved blockers under 1000 tokens. The public verifier remains read-only.
Its create/update caller owns tip-first failure localization, selects the
earliest failing bookmark/PR, dispatches the relevant fixer only after that
ownership is known, and restarts the complete gate at new exact revision IDs. Any
ordinary or unapproved nonzero applicable command, or unresolved diagnosis,
blocks publication; a confirmed missing-variable failure follows the exact
approval contract above. Any separate review is read-only.

## Verification

Return `pass` only when every test and lint command from every included
`pull_request` workflow exits zero at the exact target/base surface and the
complete receipt records the exact target revision ID, base revision ID, kind,
`conservative_pull_request` applicability, the `jj-run` execution engine, and
canonical workflow command/result set. A pass additionally proves
`--clean --ignore-changes --root -r "$TARGET_SHA"` was used for every task and
that `JJ_COMMIT_ID` matched the target. The sole alternative is a complete
`approved_without_local_run` receipt with those same fields plus the exact
target revision ID and lexically sorted names in `missing_secret_approval`. Always close
the retained lease before returning.
