# Create or Update Pull Requests

## Workflow at a glance

1. Resolve the requested change or linear stack, its GitHub push remote, open PRs, exact heads and bases, required PR shape, and known issue identities; search for issues only when none is known and the user permits search.
2. Audit submitted files and apply every relevant standard; run applicable pull-request tests and lint through `jj run`: integrated tip first, then every independently publishable surface bottom-up.
3. Publish saved bookmarks bottom-up, author and scan each PR body, apply its available archetype label, and verify the remote head, base, draft state, body, and labels.
4. Perform mandatory PR review with a fresh independent subagent, converging findings by repairing the owning change and restarting invalidated discovery and verification gates.
5. Poll every published PR until hosted CI is green; diagnose the first red surface, fix its root cause, republish, and repeat without hiding blockers.

Load the complete workflow from `coding:pr create` or `coding:pr update`; `coding:pr author` loads only [Author the PR text](#author-the-pr-text). Turn one saved change or stack into live PRs, initially draft and ready after review approval, then green through CI. This workflow composes deterministic Conventional Commits PR text, publishes bottom-up, and owns hosted CI until green or blocked. Repair obeys the **Coherence Mandate**: produce one continuous work; rewrite over restructure, restructure over integrate, never append. Dissolve new content into the existing structure. Visible seams, parallel paths, addenda, vestigial helpers, and tack-ons are forbidden.

Reviewers own size-standard findings and reviewability judgments. This workflow owns pull-request authoring and publication directions, deterministic zone calculation, and the gates below. Scan each implementation diff and rendered PR body against `coding:standards/git/`; [message.md](../templates/message.md) owns the bundled body shape.

## Pull-request directions

- Format the title as a Conventional Commit subject.
- Keep issue-closing directives out of newly authored titles and bodies. Use plain references; `directions/issues.md` under `CODING_PR_SKILL_DIR` owns resolving associations and their verification.
- Open every human-authored PR as a draft. A documented incident may authorize a hotfix exception; automated dependency or generator PRs follow their platform configuration.
- Use a repository-local PR template when present; otherwise render [message.md](../templates/message.md). Keep labels and size bookkeeping out of the title and body.
- Before submission, inspect every changed file under `GIT-PR-TYPE-05` for a durable purpose and remove prohibited artifacts through the implementation/history owner. Select and apply every relevant standard through `essential:directions/standards.md`; fix violations and record green revision-bound evidence in Verification before publication.
- Bind authoring and review evidence to the exact head and base OIDs. Reset reviewer evidence when either OID changes; preserve it on a no-op retry.
- Make each PR independently valid and reviewable. Keep its tests and package lockfiles with the implementation that needs them.
- Keep each PR draft through publication and review authoring. After the review loop's exit gate reports substantive `APPROVE`, it promotes that surface to ready for review and verifies the transition. A materially expanded surface returns to draft; notify reviewers when they need the changed context.

### Select the PR archetype

Select `feature-flag` only when the target project has implemented flag support and this change implements or modifies a flag. A template section or PR size does not establish project support or authorize adding it.

For each head, choose the `--archetype` value accepted by `scripts/scan-pr-message.ts` that best describes its implementation surface. This controls conditional body evidence and scanner behavior only; repository labels come only from the receiving repository's live inventory below.

## Boundaries

- Use `ACTION=create` to compose a PR title and body, publish a new saved change or ordered stack as draft PRs, and monitor every GitHub check through repair. `coding:commit --create-pr` reaches this action through its required handoff.
- Use `ACTION=update` to republish an existing draft PR or stack, refresh its title, body, and bases, and monitor every GitHub check through repair.
- Do not use for: saving work without publication (`coding:commit`), reviewing code, merging PRs (`coding:pr merge`), or creating a new stack solely by reshaping local history (`coding:commit --reorder`).
- Multi-template directories (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/*.md`) are intentionally ignored — selecting between them is a human choice and out of scope.
- Delegate noisy commands to one small read-only tester before publication and one small read-oriented poller after publication, following the repository delegation contract at `governance:standards/delegation/`.

<IMPORTANT>
- Ownership is singular: `coding:commit` owns direct history mutations; its `--reorder` workflow owns reshaping/reparenting when a root cause belongs in a lower PR outside the current PR; the core publication phase below owns batch push, restack, and PR-base mechanics. The parent alone accepts fixer edits and performs commit, push, and restack mutations; the poller may dispatch exactly one scoped fixer when the red branch requires it.
- Before every push, unless the caller explicitly supplied `--no-verify`, run the applicable `pull_request` test and lint tasks through read-only `jj run` at exact revision anchors. Run the selected tip first as a canary, then every selected PR surface bottom-up through the tip. Follow [verify.md](verify.md) for isolated tooling/dependency setup and CI environment supply. Attempt the exact command before treating an unavailable variable as a failure. Only captured failure evidence naming a missing CI-declared variable may open the per-surface exception: ask for an explicit source and rerun or approval of that exact revision and lexically sorted name list. Never infer approval from another flag or caller, invent an empty value, or push after any other unresolved local failure.
- `--no-verify` skips only this invocation's local revision-bound parity gate and must be recorded with every skipped bookmark and PR. It never skips hosted CI, review, publication checks, or authoring checks and is never implied by `--publish-only`, a commit-time flag, or missing secrets.
- Internal `--publish-only` returns after leased pushes, metadata updates, and head/base verification. It skips review and CI only because its verified review-loop or red-CI-repair parent retains convergence; it is never a direct-caller option.
- Fix root causes. MUST NOT weaken a correct test, alter a valid expectation, add ignores/suppressions, or delete checks merely to pass. Edit a test only when captured failure evidence proves the test itself is the root cause.
- Never report success while any PR in the resulting stack is pending or red.
</IMPORTANT>

## Inputs

- **Required**: `ACTION=create|update`, supplied by the router. `create` defaults to the current saved change — the jj working-copy change (`@`), or `HEAD` on the git path — and includes ordered unmerged descendants when they form a stack. `update` requires an open PR number/URL, a ref whose head has an open PR, or an unambiguous current branch with an open PR. Bind a bare number's namespace through [resolve.md](resolve.md) before treating it as a PR; a `stack` resolution selects that stack's member PRs.
- **Optional**:

| Input | Effect |
|---|---|
| `<commit-ref>` | Publish a resolvable jj change ID/revset/bookmark or git branch/SHA and its selected stack. Any jj revset (`@`, `@-`, a change id) or git ref (`HEAD`, `HEAD~1`, a SHA) also selects the commit to author from; behavior is deterministic given the ref. |
| `--branch-prefix <name>` | Override the derived stack bookmark prefix. A prefix other than a resolved stream's `<type>/<work-id>` publishes a branch that will not resolve back to its work state — expected for a branch predating that convention, deliberate otherwise. |
| `--remote <name>` | Select the named push remote explicitly; remote names are treated as values even when they begin with `-`. |
| `--no-verify` | Explicitly skip the local revision-bound test/lint gate for this publication only. Record every skipped bookmark and PR; hosted CI and all other publication gates remain mandatory. |
| `--max-iteration <count>` | Set the maximum number of attempted exhaustive whole-stack reviews. Reject before mutation unless `<count>` is an ASCII decimal integer greater than zero; the default is `3`. |
| `--dry-run` | Print the test, publication, and monitoring plan without agents or local/remote mutations. |

- **Internal continuation**: `--publish-only` is absent from public usage. Accept it only when the current invocation was issued by [review-loop.md](review-loop.md) or [repair.md](repair.md) and carries that parent's exact stack map, head/base OIDs, expected hosted checks, and retained `MAX_ITERATION`/`REVIEW_ITERATION`. Reject a direct invocation, an unknown owner, or missing/stale convergence context before any mutation. The parent remains responsible for mandatory review and CI convergence.
- **Prerequisites**: for publication — a clean saved change or linear stack, authenticated `gh`, and remote push access. `jj` is preferred and drives publication whenever it is both installed on PATH and initialized for this repository; prove that functionally rather than by directory presence, since a `.jj` and a `.git` directory can exist without sharing a backing repository. A registered parallel workspace intentionally has no workspace-local `.git`; accept it when `jj git root` names a Git directory and the active `@-` object exists there. Use the same predicate as `sync-pr-stack.sh`:

  ```bash
  PUBLICATION_VCS=git PUBLICATION_GIT_DIR=
  if command -v jj >/dev/null 2>&1 &&
    CANDIDATE_GIT_DIR=$(jj git root 2>/dev/null) &&
    case "$CANDIDATE_GIT_DIR" in */.git) true ;; *) false ;; esac &&
    JJ_PARENT_OID=$(jj log -r @- --no-graph -T 'commit_id ++ "\n"' 2>/dev/null) &&
    git --git-dir="$CANDIDATE_GIT_DIR" cat-file -e "$JJ_PARENT_OID^{commit}" 2>/dev/null
  then PUBLICATION_VCS=jj
    PUBLICATION_GIT_DIR=$CANDIDATE_GIT_DIR
  else git rev-parse --git-dir >/dev/null || exit $?
  fi
  ```

  Anything else selects the fully supported Git path. Authoring PR text alone needs neither. Unless `--no-verify` is explicit, local CI parity additionally requires jj 0.44 or newer and exact target resolution so every task can run through `jj run`; follow the shared jj guide and `coding:sync-tool` instead of substituting a Git runner.

## State gate

Before creating or materially rewriting a project artifact, read the absolute `state.md` path injected by Essential. If unavailable, stop artifact writes and report the missing contract. Publication-only runs may proceed without creating work artifacts. Before any red-CI repair, run the resolver normally, or with `--work-id` for an explicit user override or the identifier selected by Essential's work-stream lifecycle. Treat an existing match as a candidate and reuse it only when its charter owns the repair. On `work_id_required`, a main-agent run follows that lifecycle to select an identifier and reruns without asking the user to approve it; a delegated run returns the resolver payload unless it already received the resolved work ID and root. Use only the resolved work root. Give each fixer a mission capsule with only the relevant contract/evidence paths. Fixers never write main-agent-owned pointers or overview files.

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve and plan

#### Bind the push remote

Bind `REMOTE` before any publication helper. Use the caller-selected named remote when supplied. On Git, next use the current branch's configured push remote; jj has no workspace-local Git branch, so it must skip that lookup rather than inherit the backing worktree's unrelated HEAD. Then use `remote.pushDefault`. With none configured, accept only the sole remote whose push URL resolves through GitHub. Every Git remote lookup uses `--` before the name so a remote beginning with `-` remains data, not an option:

```bash
if [ "$PUBLICATION_VCS" = jj ]; then
  PRIOR_GIT_DIR=${GIT_DIR-} PRIOR_GIT_DIR_WAS_SET=${GIT_DIR+x}
  export GIT_DIR=$PUBLICATION_GIT_DIR
fi
source "${CODING_PR_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/resolve-push-remote.sh"
if [ "$PUBLICATION_VCS" = jj ]; then
  if [ -n "$PRIOR_GIT_DIR_WAS_SET" ]; then export GIT_DIR=$PRIOR_GIT_DIR; else unset GIT_DIR; fi
fi
```

`PUBLICATION_VCS=jj` is part of the sourced resolver contract: while `PUBLICATION_GIT_DIR` exposes the shared remote configuration, the resolver must not inspect its backing Git HEAD for branch-scoped settings.

Record `REMOTE`, receiving `HOST/$REPOSITORY`, and `PUSH_OWNER` in the publication plan. On zero or ambiguous GitHub candidates, preserve the candidate evidence and stop rather than selecting one. PR discovery is always scoped with `--repo "$HOST/$REPOSITORY"`, then filtered to exact `headRepositoryOwner.login == "$PUSH_OWNER"`; a branch name alone never identifies a PR.

Inspect the selected tool's working state — `jj status`, `jj log`, and `jj bookmark list`, or `git status --short`, `git log --oneline`, and `git branch --list` — plus open PRs. Resolve `<commit-ref>` or the current saved change and list changes, bookmarks, PR heads, and bases bottom-up. Resolve each selected head to zero or one open PR: publish a missing head and update an existing one in the same pass. This per-head choice makes retrying a partially published stack idempotent. `ACTION=update` must initially resolve its explicit PR/ref target to an open PR, but may include missing descendants introduced by an accepted stack rewrite. If work must be saved, split, or reordered, invoke `coding:commit`, then restart discovery. Reject an unknown ref, nonlinear chain, merged-history rewrite, missing authentication, multiple open PRs for one head, or remote ambiguity with evidence.

Always load [stacked-prs.md](stacked-prs.md) and enforce its mandatory archetype splits. With no explicit shape, also calculate the size zone and suggest a stack when an over-green surface has independent domain-coherent slices. A declined optional suggestion or atomic change proceeds as one PR.

#### Resolve issue coverage

For each selected PR surface, collect issue numbers or URLs explicitly supplied by the user or already established in its PR/work context, including existing closing associations read through `directions/issues.md`. Bind each identity to its repository; a PR number, incidental example, or unrelated stack member's issue is not an issue identity for this surface. Preserve valid existing associations. Read a known issue directly to check whether the changes resolve it, partially address it, or merely relate to it; this identifier read is not a discovery search and still obeys any broader user restriction on GitHub access.

Invoke `coding:issue lookup` only when no issue identity is known for that surface **and** the user has not explicitly forbidden issue search. Pass the receiving repository and a description of that surface's actual changes, symptoms, and affected components. Do not search to supplement a known issue, substitute for an inaccessible known issue, or override an explicit search prohibition. An irrelevant or unavailable supplied issue is reported for correction, not silently replaced through discovery.

Use the lookup result's evidence to select relevant issues; a high search rank alone does not establish resolution. With no match, publish without creating an issue. With forbidden search and no known identity, publish without an issue association and report `search skipped: user restriction`. A lookup failure remains a failure, with its cause and incomplete coverage reported; publication may proceed without inventing coverage or treating the failure as no matches. Never invoke `coding:issue create` implicitly from PR publication.

Carry the selected identities and their resolving/partial/related disposition into publication and its final report. Keep issue content and metadata writes owned by `coding:issue`; this PR workflow owns PR references and associations. Text-only `author` never invokes lookup or other GitHub operations. On retries, reuse established identities and recheck their relevance if the selected change surface changed; do not repeat discovery simply because publication is retried.

With `--dry-run`, print the exact plan after this read-only coverage step, including issue identities, lookup/skip decisions, dispositions, proposed association changes, and unresolved coverage. Stop before any write, including link changes.

### 2. Verify exact local CI parity before publication

After stack discovery, resolve each selected head and its intended PR base to immutable revision IDs. Encode them in `SELECTED_STACK_JSON` as objects with `head` and `base` fields plus the discovered `bookmark` and PR identity, ordered bottom-up; a standalone target has one object. Derive the canary target from that map: the last selected head is the target revision and the first selected head's base is the target base revision. The tip's immediate PR base is not the selected canary base.

```bash
SELECTED_HEAD_COUNT=$(jq -er 'length | select(. > 0)' <<<"$SELECTED_STACK_JSON")
TARGET_SHA=$(jq -er '.[-1].head | select(type == "string" and length > 0)' \
  <<<"$SELECTED_STACK_JSON")
TARGET_BASE=$(jq -er '.[0].base | select(type == "string" and length > 0)' \
  <<<"$SELECTED_STACK_JSON")
case "$SELECTED_HEAD_COUNT" in
  1)
    TARGET_KIND=standalone
    ;;
  *)
    test "$SELECTED_HEAD_COUNT" -gt 1 || exit 2
    TARGET_KIND=stack-tip
    ;;
esac
printf 'TARGET_KIND=%s\nTARGET_SHA=%s\nTARGET_BASE=%s\n' \
  "$TARGET_KIND" "$TARGET_SHA" "$TARGET_BASE"
```

With `--no-verify`, record `local_verification: skipped_by_user` with the exact ordered bookmark, PR, head, and base map, then continue to publication. Do not create a parity receipt, treat the skip as a missing-secret approval, or reuse the skip after this invocation.

Otherwise invoke the public parity action with the three bound canary inputs:

```text
coding:pr verify --target "$TARGET_SHA" --base "$TARGET_BASE" --kind "$TARGET_KIND"
```

For a standalone surface, that successful canary is the complete local gate. For a stack, a successful canary proves the integrated tip first; next, rebind `TARGET_SHA` and `TARGET_BASE` to each object's `head` and immediate `base`, set `TARGET_KIND=standalone`, and invoke the same public action bottom-up through the tip. The tip is deliberately run again against its immediate PR base so both the integrated stack and every independently publishable PR surface have exact evidence.

If the canary is red, do not push or repair it immediately. Run the same action bottom-up until the first red surface. The first failure is the earliest broken bookmark/PR even when a later commit masks that failure at the tip; retain its command output and the verifier's diagnosis. Stop the traversal there, fix the root cause in that owning change through `coding:commit` and the shared `jj edit` route when applicable, then restart stack discovery and the entire tip-first gate. If the canary is green but a bottom-up surface is red, apply the same earliest-surface rule. Never test higher surfaces after the first bottom-up failure because their inputs will be invalidated by the repair.

For every successful action, capture its complete `CI_PARITY_RECEIPT_JSON`, its canonical `CI_PARITY_EXPECTED_WORKFLOW_COMMAND_RESULTS_JSON`, and its canonical `CI_PARITY_EXPECTED_MISSING_SECRET_NAMES_JSON`; bind the receipt to the surface's bookmark and PR identity. Consume each receipt immediately and replay the same gate for the complete ordered receipt set before every entry or re-entry to publication:

```bash
source "${CODING_PR_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/validate-ci-parity-receipt.sh"
```

A rewrite, base-map change, bookmark/PR identity change, or command/result-set change invalidates the complete receipt set and restarts discovery before this step.

### 3. Publish bottom-up

Before every entry or re-entry to this phase, either confirm the invocation's explicit `--no-verify` record still matches the complete selected stack or rerun the receipt gate above against every current bound surface in the ordered receipt set. On a missing-secret exception path, each approval's `sha` equals that surface's exact `TARGET_SHA` and its `names` equal the verifier's exact lexically sorted missing-secret names. A SHA-only approval or any name/order mismatch, like a missing surface receipt, returns to step 2 before a remote mutation. For each rebound surface, its `sha` equals the exact `TARGET_SHA`; its sorted names and complete receipt remain inseparable from that target.

Require a saved, clean, linear chain to the selected `ROOT_BASE`/`DESTINATION` at authoritative `$REMOTE`, standalone green changes, conventional descriptions per [commit-message standard](../../../standards/commit/write.md), no selected change already merged at `$REMOTE`, and a derived or supplied branch prefix. If needed, invoke `coding:commit --reorder`; for merged history follow [merged.md](../../commit/directions/merged.md).

Bottom-up, preserve a change's existing bookmark when the caller selected that branch, it heads an open PR, or the stack already has explicit bookmarks: include that exact head in publication. A bare `<branch-prefix>` head blocks its own `NN-` children, so a stream growing into a stack renames it — local ref and forge alike, since either blocks the child — before pushing the rest, per Essential's naming contract. Only for an unbookmarked new change/stack: a lone change takes `BOOKMARK=<branch-prefix>`, a stack indexes `NN` from `01` to `99` into `BOOKMARK=<prefix>/NN-<scope>`, kebab-case scope ≤30 characters; `<branch-prefix>` is `--branch-prefix`, else the resolved stream's branch, else as derived; record the mode first.

If the immediate predecessor is selected, set `PR_BASE` to its bookmark and `AUTHOR_BASE_OID` to its change/commit OID. Otherwise preserve an existing PR's base; for a new PR resolve the immediate unmerged predecessor, using the repository default branch only when none exists, then resolve that exact base commit as `AUTHOR_BASE_OID`. New-stack bookmarks do not yet exist, so author each head against `AUTHOR_BASE_OID`, never `PR_BASE`.

#### Discover and select repository labels

Bind `HOST` and `REPOSITORY` to the receiving repository for this PR, using the existing PR URL on update or the intended PR target on create. Fetch its complete label inventory before publication:

```bash
REPOSITORY_LABELS=$(bash \
  "${CODING_PR_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/list-repository-labels.sh" \
  "$HOST" "$REPOSITORY")
```

<IMPORTANT>
The helper returns deterministic JSON containing every exact label `name` and `description` from every API page. Inspect both fields and choose zero or more suitable names only from that output. Never create, guess, substitute, or remove labels. Set `SELECTED_LABELS` to a JSON array of those exact choices, including `[]` when no label is suitable.
</IMPORTANT>

#### Validate selected repository labels

Validate every per-head selection before any ref or remote mutation:

```bash
jq -e --argjson repository_labels "$REPOSITORY_LABELS" '
  type == "array" and all(.[];
    type == "string" and
    (. as $selected | any($repository_labels[]; .name == $selected))
  )
' \
  >/dev/null <<<"$SELECTED_LABELS" || exit $?
```

Split each exact `title\n\nbody` into that head's `TITLE` and `BODY`; malformed output aborts the whole selection before any ref or remote mutation.

After every per-head `PR_BASE` is resolved, bind the batch root to the first selected affected head's exact base:

```bash
ROOT_BASE=$PR_BASE_01
ROOT_BASE_ROW=$(gh api --hostname "$HOST" \
  "repos/$REPOSITORY/git/ref/heads/$ROOT_BASE")
ROOT_BASE_OID=$(jq -er --arg ref "refs/heads/$ROOT_BASE" '
  select(.ref == $ref and .object.type == "commit") | .object.sha
' <<<"$ROOT_BASE_ROW")
printf 'ROOT_BASE=%s\nROOT_BASE_OID=%s\n' "$ROOT_BASE" "$ROOT_BASE_OID"
```

For a suffix restack, `PR_BASE_01` is the unselected predecessor, not the repository destination. The receiving repository's exact base ref is authoritative even when heads publish to a fork; never derive `ROOT_BASE_OID` from the selected push remote. During the same discovery snapshot, bind each remote head as `EXPECTED_REMOTE_OID_NN=<full-oid>` or `absent` when the remote ref does not exist. Record `ROOT_BASE`, `ROOT_BASE_OID`, repository, owner, remote, and these remote OIDs with the selected head/base map. Keep them unchanged for a retry only while that selection and map remain unchanged. Any discovery restart, remote/base identity change, or base-map change recomputes all of them before the next helper call.

On the jj path, all history edits and existing-bookmark movement belong to `coding:commit`; rely on jj's automatic descendant rebase and bookmark movement. Only during initial publication, establish the identity of an unbookmarked change before the batch push:

```bash
jj bookmark create "$BOOKMARK" --revision "$CHANGE_ID"
```

Never run that command for an update or to move an existing bookmark. Collect every affected unmerged bookmark and its exact expected local revision anchor for the single batch publication below.

On the git path, prepare the local branch; the helper owns its only push:

```bash
git branch --force "$BOOKMARK" "$CHANGE_ID"
```

The helper's Git push is leased with the caller-bound `--force-with-lease=refs/heads/<bookmark>:<expected-remote-oid>`; `absent` uses an empty expected value to protect missing-ref creation, and its refspec uses the bound full local OID rather than a mutable branch name. Its jj path observes each remote before and after fetch, binds one immutable post-fetch operation, then issues one explicit multi-bookmark push at that operation and relies on jj's post-fetch lease.

Before pushing an existing PR, reconcile selected existing closing links whose disposition becomes partial or related through `directions/issues.md`, against the saved current remote head/base pair and the intended diff. Remove and verify only proven stale manual links; unresolved intent or failed removal blocks that surface and its dependent publication before the push. Preserve other links.

Before creating or editing PRs, publish the complete affected selection through the helper in one call:

```bash
if SYNC_RECEIPT=$(bash "${CODING_PR_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/sync-pr-stack.sh" \
  --repo "$HOST/$REPOSITORY" --head-owner "$PUSH_OWNER" --remote "$REMOTE" \
  --base "$ROOT_BASE" --base-oid "$ROOT_BASE_OID" \
  --head "$BOOKMARK_01" "$EXPECTED_HEAD_OID_01" "$EXPECTED_REMOTE_OID_01" \
  --head "$BOOKMARK_02" "$EXPECTED_HEAD_OID_02" "$EXPECTED_REMOTE_OID_02")
then SYNC_STATUS=0
else SYNC_STATUS=$?
fi
jq -e '(.vcs == "git" or .vcs == "jj") and (.items|type == "array") and (.errors|type == "array")' >/dev/null <<<"$SYNC_RECEIPT" || exit 1
[ "$SYNC_STATUS" -eq 0 ] || { jq '{items, errors}' <<<"$SYNC_RECEIPT" >&2; exit "$SYNC_STATUS"; }
```

On jj this produces one `jj git push --remote "$REMOTE"` with repeated explicit `--bookmark` selectors for all and only affected unmerged heads; it never uses `--all`. On plain Git the helper publishes bottom-up with the exact leases above. Do not follow a jj batch with gh-stack rebase, sync, push, or submit. Preserve stderr and parse `SYNC_RECEIPT.items`, including each `head_status`, `base_status`, `observed_remote_oid`, numeric `pr_number`, and exact head/base read-back, plus its structured `errors`. Every live head must be `verified` before the helper starts any base edit. A missing PR reports `base_status: deferred`; creation remains here.

Interpret every status literally:

- `head_status`: `pending` was not attempted; `planned` is dry-run only; `verified` matches the bound local OID on the remote; `skipped_merged` is an exact merged PR omitted from publication; `failed` requires fresh discovery.
- `base_status`: `pending` was not attempted; `planned` is dry-run only; `verified` passed numeric PR identity and exact base read-back; `deferred` requires PR creation and its separate verification below; `not_applicable` belongs only to a merged PR; `failed` requires fresh discovery.

A successful non-dry run has no errors, every live head is `verified`, and every existing open PR base is `verified`; `deferred` and `skipped_merged` are terminal only through their actions above. A handled nonzero still carries the complete partial receipt: parse it before stopping, preserve verified prefix work, and restart discovery through the matching recovery row. Dry-run success contains only `planned`, `deferred`, or `not_applicable` mutation statuses and authorizes no push, edit, or creation. When the head has no open PR, create a draft:

```bash
PR=$(gh pr create --repo "$HOST/$REPOSITORY" --draft --title "$TITLE" --body-file - \
  --base "$PR_BASE" --head "$PUSH_OWNER:$BOOKMARK" <<<"$BODY")
```

After creation, read back that numeric PR with `--repo "$HOST/$REPOSITORY"` and verify its number, `headRepositoryOwner.login`, `headRefOid`, `baseRefName`, and `baseRefOid` against the bound owner, head, base name, and base OID; require `state: OPEN` and `isDraft: true`. Creation is not complete until this deferred base and draft state become verified.

When the head has one open PR, reread its body and closing associations at the verified published head/base pair. Before removing a valid body-based closing directive, use `directions/issues.md` to establish and verify its manual replacement. A failed or unverified conversion blocks the body edit: leave the existing body untouched, report the pending conversion, and continue CI monitoring for any already-published head. Never restore or newly publish a closing directive. Reconcile concurrent body edits before submitting the revised text. Once this gate passes, edit the PR and retain draft state:

```bash
gh pr edit "$PR" --title "$TITLE" --body-file - --base "$PR_BASE" <<<"$BODY"
gh pr ready "$PR" --undo
```

Read back the same metadata after an update and require the bound head/base pair, `state: OPEN`, and `isDraft: true`. A successful mutation command alone does not establish publication or draft state.

#### Verify issue Development links

For every selected issue disposition under [Resolve issue coverage](#resolve-issue-coverage), load `directions/issues.md` from `CODING_PR_SKILL_DIR` after the numeric PR and its head/base pair are verified. Add missing resolving links, preserve valid links, and verify that partial or merely related work has no selected stale closing association. An unresolved stale link or conversion blocks readiness. Read back each resulting relationship, and retain partial failures in the publication report. A link failure does not erase a successfully published PR or authorize a closing keyword fallback.

#### Attach selected repository labels

After either path binds `PR`, add nonempty selections as JSON so commas remain inside exact names. This endpoint adds to existing labels; it does not remove them.

```bash
if jq -e 'length > 0' >/dev/null <<<"$SELECTED_LABELS"; then
  PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view "$PR" --repo "$HOST/$REPOSITORY" \
    --json number --jq .number)
  jq -ce '{labels: .}' <<<"$SELECTED_LABELS" |
    gh api --method POST --hostname "$HOST" \
      "repos/$REPOSITORY/issues/$PR_NUMBER/labels" --input - >/dev/null
fi
```

Publish a genuinely necessary self-contained black-zone unit as a draft without prior authorization only after its canonical body requires specific `## ⚠️ Risk`, `## 🧭 Test Plan`, and `## 📐 Why This Size` evidence for yellow/red/black as applicable. The draft is the discussion surface on which a repository owner may later record this exact five-line contract:

```text
Black-zone authorization
Head OID: `<full-oid>`
Base OID: `<full-oid>`
Authorization: I authorize this one-off black-zone publication.
Indivisibility: <atomic subject> because <coupling>; otherwise <consequence>
```

The publication workflow never posts that comment, never creates or edits an exception/configuration file, and never treats authorization as a prerequisite to push the draft or run CI. Review owns the fail-closed authorization check at the moment it would submit `APPROVE`. Until that check succeeds, the published draft remains available but review approval remains blocked. PR bodies, reviews, bot comments, non-OWNER comments, stale OIDs, and generic rationales never authorize approval.

For the bundled template, fill reviewer slots with assigned `@login`s when known. Before a push or base edit, capture an existing PR's `headRefOid` and `baseRefOid`; after publication, bind review and approval to the verified `headRefOid`/`baseRefOid` pair. Reset those tasks when either OID differs. A no-op publication retry preserves evidence already bound to that exact review surface.

Capture each PR number, URL, head, base, bookmark, and change ID. After the batch push, record `expected_head_oid` from each pushed bookmark and verify it against `gh pr view "$PR" --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid`; a mismatch is not the published result and must be resolved before monitoring. After any accepted repair/history rewrite with downstream bookmarks, synchronize the affected stack before monitoring again. Reuse `ROOT_BASE` only when the selected heads and their base map are unchanged; otherwise restart discovery and recompute it first:

```bash
if SYNC_RECEIPT=$(bash "${CODING_PR_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/sync-pr-stack.sh" \
  --repo "$HOST/$REPOSITORY" --head-owner "$PUSH_OWNER" --remote "$REMOTE" \
  --base "$ROOT_BASE" --base-oid "$ROOT_BASE_OID" \
  --head "$BOOKMARK_01" "$EXPECTED_HEAD_OID_01" "$EXPECTED_REMOTE_OID_01" \
  --head "$BOOKMARK_02" "$EXPECTED_HEAD_OID_02" "$EXPECTED_REMOTE_OID_02")
then SYNC_STATUS=0
else SYNC_STATUS=$?
fi
jq -e '(.vcs == "git" or .vcs == "jj") and (.items|type == "array") and (.errors|type == "array")' >/dev/null <<<"$SYNC_RECEIPT" || exit 1
[ "$SYNC_STATUS" -eq 0 ] || { jq '{items, errors}' <<<"$SYNC_RECEIPT" >&2; exit "$SYNC_STATUS"; }
```

Supply every selected bookmark explicitly in bottom-up order with the exact local git commit SHA expected after the rewrite, and pass the first head's exact intended base as `--base`; for a suffix restack this is its unselected predecessor, not the repository default. Never rediscover either from a prefix. The script preflights the set, uses leased pushes, verifies every remote SHA, and updates open PR bases by retained numeric PR ID; it never reshapes history. Forge operations are not transactional: recover from each item's `head_status` and `base_status`, never infer success from process progress. `verified` heads may coexist with `failed`, `pending`, or `deferred` bases. Restart discovery whenever any bound remote or base identity changed. Verify the PR base chain and every `headRefOid`, then reauthor changed heads against verified bases and reset reviewer evidence only where the head or base OID changed.

With an accepted internal `--publish-only`, return the verified stack map plus refreshed expected hosted checks and their workflow/ruleset/config inputs. Do not enter review or hosted-CI convergence; the verified invoking review or red-CI parent owns the next step.

### 4. Converge review comments

For a top-level create or update, the owning main agent retains `MAX_ITERATION` from `--max-iteration` or its default and starts `REVIEW_ITERATION` at zero in its working context. It keeps both values across nested publish-only and CI-repair calls without putting them on another CLI; only [review-loop.md](review-loop.md) increments the current iteration.

After every selected PR is published or updated and its open draft state and exact head/base pair are verified, load and follow [review-loop.md](review-loop.md). A review-driven fix republishes the affected stack, resets the expected head OIDs, and runs the loop again with a fresh subagent before CI monitoring. If the loop returns `action: repair_ci_then_review`, enter step 5 immediately without marking review convergence complete or attempting another review against unchanged CI. After the poller reports a red repair, the parent accepts the fix, saves it, and republishes through the owned workflow; if CI instead becomes green, no repair is needed. Then return to step 4 and run a fresh review pass before completing the ordinary CI gate. Never retry a review against unchanged red-CI evidence.

If the loop returns `action: await_owner_authorization`, record the approval blocker and its complete `authorization_required` list, including each PR URL and exact head/base OIDs, then enter step 5 without marking review convergence complete or retrying the review. After CI is green, report the published drafts with that list under `approval_blocked: authorization_required`. A later invocation reruns review against every then-current head and base; review alone verifies each authorization at the moment it would submit `APPROVE`.

If the loop returns `action: review_exhausted`, record the unresolved findings and enter step 5. Converge hosted CI normally; once it is green, report green CI and missing substantive approval instead of dispatching another review.

### 5. Schedule and consume the initial poll

Immediately after every initial publication, use the recurring scheduling capability at a five-minute interval with actual bottom-to-top PR URLs substituted into this payload:

```text
Dispatch ONE small read-oriented polling subagent for <stack PR URLs> in bottom-up order. Pass it the stack and discovered expected hosted checks, and require it to load and follow the Poll contract in coding:pr directions/create-update.md; only when it classifies a red check, require it to load directions/repair.md. Consume its bounded <report>, then take the parent action it requests. The scheduled parent MUST NOT run gh polling itself.
```

Capture the returned task/job ID as `active_schedule_id`. Cancel only that exact ID with the task-ID cancellation capability or the scheduler's natural cancellation keyed by the same ID; never cancel by cadence or description.

#### Poll contract

The one poller queries every PR bottom-up, without `--required` or filtering:

```bash
gh pr checks <pr> --json bucket,completedAt,link,name,startedAt,state,workflow
```

Before consuming checks, query the current PR `headRefOid` and require it to equal the parent's recorded `expected_head_oid`. Treat a mismatch as pending with explicit stale-head evidence; never accept checks from an older or unexpected revision.

It is read-oriented: it may inspect with `gh` and, only through the red reference, dispatch exactly one scoped fixer; it MUST NOT edit, commit, rebase, restack, or push. It returns under 1000 tokens:

<report>

```yaml
stack:
  - pr: <number-or-url>
    head: <bookmark>
    head_oid: <current remote PR head SHA>
    expected_head_oid: <SHA recorded immediately after the latest push>
    base: <base branch>
    config_ref: <workflow/ruleset ref confirmed for this head/base>
    state: green | pending | red
    expected_checks:
      - name: <workflow job or required status name>
        source: <workflow path/job, branch protection, or ruleset>
    inaccessible_expected_sources: [<source and access error>]
    observed_checks:
      - name: <name>
        workflow: <workflow>
        bucket: <bucket>
        state: <state>
        link: <url>
        started_at: <timestamp>
        completed_at: <timestamp or null>
        wall_time_seconds: <completedAt-startedAt or null>
schedule:
  task_id: <active_loop_id>
  action: keep | cancel | replace
red_repair: <report from repair.md or null>
blocker: <configuration/provider blocker or null>
unresolved: [<remaining blocker>]
action: notify_and_cancel | wait | parent_repair | blocked
```

</report>

Classify every returned check from both `bucket` and `state`, with precedence red, pending, green:

- **Red**: any check has a fail/cancel bucket or failure, cancelled, or timed-out state. Cancel `active_loop_id`, process the earliest red PR, and load [repair.md](repair.md). The poller follows that conditional reference before returning its report.
- **Pending**: none are red and any check is pending, queued, expected, waiting, in progress, lacks `completedAt`, belongs to a mismatched head SHA, or is an expected check not yet observed. Match matrix jobs using the documented stable job-name prefix captured during discovery; otherwise require an exact name match. Zero observed with a confirmed nonempty expected list is pending. Keep `active_loop_id`, make no edits, dispatch no fixer, and return `action: wait` for the next wake.
- **Green**: every observed check is pass/success, skipping/skipped, or an explicitly accepted neutral result, every expected check has a matched terminal accepted observation for `expected_head_oid`, and no observed check is red or pending. Zero observed is green only after refreshing the remote PR head, confirming current workflow/base required-status/ruleset configuration, and proving the expected list empty; retain expected/observed evidence. When every PR is green, cancel `active_loop_id`, notify, and stop.

For zero observed checks with inaccessible/unconfirmed expected sources, keep the PR pending, cancel the loop, and return top-level `action: blocked` with head/config/source/access evidence. Never use an arbitrary timeout to infer a state.

Scheduled tasks fire only while the session is open and idle. Unexpired tasks restore on `--resume` or `--continue`; expired tasks are not replayed.

### Author the PR text

Compose deterministic `title\n\nbody` for a commit and optional base. Step 3 passes its base; text-only callers default to the first parent. Never invoke `gh`.

1. Resolve the commit ref, defaulting to `@` after the functional jj check and to `HEAD` otherwise. Resolve an optional base, defaulting to the first parent or, for a root commit, the empty tree from `git hash-object -t tree /dev/null`. Try `jj log -r <ref> --no-graph -T 'description'`, then `git log -1 --format=%B <ref>`. Unknown refs exit 2; neither tool exits 3. Record the resolved head/base OIDs for step 4.
2. Extract the subject (first non-empty line) and body (everything after the first blank line). Recognize reference, breaking-change, and verification trailers for routing in step 6. When historical input contains issue-closing directives, retain the issue identities as plain references in the new PR text; never copy the directives or rewrite the historical commit. Extracting an identity does not establish that the current PR resolves it.
3. Validate the subject against the canonical regex and type allowlist in the [commit-message standard](../../../standards/commit/write.md), which owns both. Read it at this step rather than restating it here. On mismatch, exit 2 with the failing token, the regex read from the standard, and the offending subject.
4. For every non-root commit, resolve the review surface from the merge base: use `jj log --no-graph -T 'commit_id' -r "heads(::<head-oid> & ::<base-oid>)"` on the jj path or `git merge-base <base-oid> <head-oid>` on the git path. Use the empty tree only for the root-commit fallback. Calculate the active size zone from that exact surface under `GIT-PR-SIZE-*`. Run the classifier only after binding the exact base and head OIDs; it derives the zone for this authoring step and is not a policy authority:

   ```bash
   SIZE_JSON=$(bun run "${CODING_PR_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/classify-pr-size.ts" \
     --repo "$REPO_ROOT" --base "$BASE_OID" --head "$HEAD_OID")
   ```

   Read `zone`, `files_changed`, `net_loc`, and `required_reviewers` from `SIZE_JSON`. The classifier's file count includes every changed path and excludes generated-file additions and deletions only from authored net LOC. The canonical thresholds are fixed. Record the required sections for that zone. A black-zone change remains black and requires specific `## ⚠️ Risk`, `## 🧭 Test Plan`, and `## 📐 Why This Size` evidence. Author them for the exact draft head/base pair that may carry later OWNER discussion authorization. The draft may be pushed and tested without prior authorization; review verifies authorization only before submitting `APPROVE`.
5. Resolve the template — first hit wins, paths relative to the repo root:

   1. `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
   2. `.github/pull_request_template.md`
   3. `docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
   4. `docs/pull_request_template.md`
   5. `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
   6. `pull_request_template.md`

   <IMPORTANT>A repo-local template is emitted verbatim — never fill placeholders in or otherwise mutate a foreign template; skip placeholder filling in step 6.</IMPORTANT> Before emission, apply step 6's evidence predicates to the content—every predicate, including always-required, zone-required, archetype-required, and diff-required. Stop when a required section is missing, empty, placeholder-only, generic, or lacks its named evidence. This validation never inserts category, label, title, or body metadata. In particular:
   - every body contains a non-empty Summary, `## 🎯 Goal`, `## ✅ Requirements`, `## 🧵 Context`, `## 🧪 Verification`, and `## 📋 Additional Notes`; Additional Notes preserves the separate-review instruction in the bundled template; Goal states the intended outcome, while Requirements lists observable, testable behavior rather than generic gates such as tests passing, standards compliance, or green CI;
   - every `##` section heading starts with an emoji, and every section the template permits authors to omit ends with the exact `[ Optional ]` suffix; the suffix describes template conditionality and does not waive a zone, archetype, or diff requirement;
   - a red- or black-zone `## 📐 Why This Size` contains specific indivisibility prose, and a black-zone body also contains specific Risk and Test plan evidence;
   - a `migration`, `feature-flag`, or `ui` PR supplies the corresponding Rollback, Feature Flag, or Screenshots evidence from step 6; and
   - whenever the review diff contains generated files, the body contains the exact `## 🏭 Generated Files` heading with at least one generated path or path pattern and its source or generator. A heading alone, `N/A`, "generated files present", or another path-free summary is generic and blocks emission.

   A heading's presence alone never passes. When no repo-local template exists, fall back to the bundled default at [message.md](../templates/message.md) and continue. When the bundled default is also missing: exit 4, print the path that failed to resolve.
6. Fill the bundled default's placeholders from the commit body, diff, and recorded verification evidence. Before matching a Markdown section name, strip its leading emoji token and trailing `[ Optional ]` suffix so the canonical template headings and their plain aliases resolve identically:
   - `{{summary_paragraph}}` — first body paragraph (≤3 sentences); fall back to the subject text after `: ` when the body is empty.
   - `{{goal_body}}` — exact content under `## Goal` / `Goal:` / `Intent:` / `Purpose:`; otherwise the first body paragraph, then the subject text after `: `. It states the outcome and why it matters, not the implementation.
   - `{{requirements_body}}` — bullets under `## Requirements` / `Requirements:` / `Acceptance Criteria:` / `Behavior:`. Each item names observable, testable behavior. Stop when none exist or when every item is a generic process gate such as passing tests, following standards, or keeping CI green; never infer requirements from implementation details.
   - `{{context_body}}` — content under `## Context` / `Why:` / `Background:`. Stop when absent rather than duplicating Summary or inventing background from the diff.
   - `{{specification_body}}` — content under `## Spec` / `Spec:` / `Specification:`; a canonical committed-doc path or external page such as Notion. Stop when absent rather than inventing a link. Before rendering, read the active work's `goal.md`. When source kind is `external`, require its canonical specification to be one HTTP(S) link and use only that URL in the PR. Reject a body that cites `.state`, `spec/`, a transport mirror, an absolute local path, or `file://` for the specification. Do not substitute the readable copy or receipt. For local or inline authority, ordinary committed-document links remain allowed.
   - `{{implementation_body}}` — content under `## Implementation` / `What:` / `How:`, if present.
   - `{{breaking_changes_body}}` — `BREAKING CHANGE:` footers; "None." when absent.
   - `{{rollback_body}}` — exact rollback steps or explicit forward-only mitigation. Required for the `migration` archetype.
   - `{{feature_flag_body}}` — flag name, default state, removal target, rollout plan, and cleanup change. Required for the `feature-flag` archetype.
   - `{{screenshots_body}}` — before/after screenshots and relevant accessibility notes. Required for the `ui` archetype.
   - `{{generated_files_body}}` — every generated path and its source or generator. Required whenever the diff contains generated files; only package lockfiles may remain in the head under `GIT-PR-TYPE-05`, and removed artifacts are identified as deleted.
   - `{{risk_body}}` — exact content under `## Risk` / `Risk:`. Required for yellow/red/black; stop when absent rather than inventing it from the diff.
   - `{{test_plan_body}}` — exact content under `## Test plan` / `Test-Plan:`. Required for yellow/red/black; stop when absent.
   - `{{why_this_size_body}}` — exact content under `## Why this size`. Required for red and black. Require specific prose explaining why the surface is indivisible; stop when it is absent or generic. Do not render size counts, zone metadata, or reviewer-time estimates.
   - `{{related_issues_body}}` — plain issue references from `Refs:` trailers or normalized historical issue identities; "None." when absent. Publication may additionally supply its resolved issue-coverage context; text-only authoring never searches.
   - `{{verification_body}}` — `Testing:` / `Manual-Test:` trailers, rendered as a checklist of the checks that must pass before sign-off, specific to this change and ticked as each one is confirmed. Keep each check with its result and revision-bound evidence. Name every applicable standard selected through `essential:directions/standards.md`, its green scan/review result, the exact head/base OIDs, and the command or semantic evidence supporting it. Resolve every standards violation before submission; pending reviewer slots do not stand in for standards verification. Change-specific checks remain mandatory. When Additional Notes records deviations from the specification or original request, append `- [ ] Specification deviations approved: <what changed and why>`. Append one assigned/reviewed/approved reviewer triplet per `required_reviewers`, in slot order, using the exact head/base OIDs recorded in step 4 and the template's Verification shape.
   - `{{boundary_body}}` — bullets naming related work the instruction placed outside this change, so its edges are not read as gaps. It records the scope it was given, not the author's own judgment calls. "None." when absent.
   - `{{additional_notes_body}}` — deviations from the specification or original request (what changed and why), known limitations, and follow-ups; empty when absent. Preserve the template's visible separate-review instruction even when this placeholder is empty.

   Drop an optional section that resolves to "None." rather than leaving a stub. Never publish a generic or missing always-, zone-, archetype-, or diff-required section; stop and report the missing evidence when it cannot be derived specifically. Strip every author-facing guidance comment and `[ Optional ]` heading marker from the rendered body; keep Summary, Goal, Requirements, Context, Verification, and Additional Notes always.
7. After rendering and before emission or publication, inspect the entire title/body for issue-closing directives, including inflected keywords with qualified references or URLs. Replace directives in authored text with plain references. A repository template that requires forbidden directives conflicts with this contract: report the conflict rather than silently changing the template or publishing its directives. Scan the body against its selected template and active standard conditions. Build repeated `--generated-file` arguments from every generated path in `SIZE_JSON`, then run:

   ```bash
   if ! MESSAGE_SCAN=$(bun run "${CODING_PR_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/scan-pr-message.ts" \
     --body-file - --template "$TEMPLATE" --zone "$ZONE" \
     --archetype "$ARCHETYPE" --head-oid "$HEAD_OID" \
     --base-oid "$BASE_OID" --allow-pending-reviewers \
     "${GENERATED_ARGS[@]}" <<<"$BODY"); then
     printf '%s\n' "$MESSAGE_SCAN" >&2
     exit 5
   fi
   ```

   Exit 5 with the scanner's JSON when it reports a violation. Do not publish or reinterpret the failure as advice; fix the owning standard rule and rerender. The scanner establishes structural conformance while semantic review establishes whether the evidence is specific and true. The authoring-only pending flag permits unchecked reviewer tasks before anyone can review; the review workflow omits it and requires confirmed triplets.
8. Emit the title line, a single blank line, then the Markdown body to stdout. Exit codes: `0` success, `2` unknown ref or non-conventional subject, `3` no commit source available, `4` bundled default template missing, `5` rendered message violates `coding:standards/git/`.

## Verification and Completion

- For each surface, report known issue identities, whether search ran or was skipped and why, lookup failures or coverage limits, selected issue dispositions, and added/preserved/removed/failed Development links with read-back evidence. No issue was created implicitly; lookup ran only when identity was unknown and search was permitted. A published PR with unverified required links is partial completion, never a fully successful association.
- The title matches the Conventional Commits regex and the rendered body passes [scan-pr-message.ts](../scripts/scan-pr-message.ts). Every emitted body has behavioral Goal and Requirements sections and emoji-prefixed headings with no `[ Optional ]` authoring markers; a repo template is verbatim, or the bundled default has no placeholder or dropped-section stub. The same head OID, base/empty-tree OID, template, thresholds, and placeholder map yield byte-identical `title\n\nbody` without timestamps or random IDs.
- Unless `--no-verify` was explicitly recorded, the applicable `pull_request` test and lint tasks passed through read-only `jj run` first at the exact selected tip and then at every selected PR head bottom-up, with revision-bound sources and results. The sole per-surface exception records the user's explicit approval for that exact revision and the verifier's exact lexically sorted missing-secret names. A `--no-verify` run instead reports every skipped bookmark, PR, head, and base; hosted CI remains mandatory.
- Every head was pushed under a lease — one explicit affected-bookmark `jj git push` on the jj path, `git push --force-with-lease` on the git path; each new PR started as a draft, uses the authored title/body, and has the intended stack base. The review loop verifies approved surfaces are ready for review.
- Review convergence produced a substantive `APPROVE` on each final head, including required replies and repair heads; or the configured review maximum was exhausted and green CI plus missing substantive approval is reported.
- Self-contained black-zone drafts may be reported as published and green while carrying `approval_blocked: authorization_required` plus the complete list of blocked PR URLs and exact head/base OIDs. This is not review convergence or merge readiness. Only the review workflow may clear each blocker, by verifying a current OWNER comment immediately before it submits `APPROVE`.
- Report success only after the final poll observes every PR green. Include the stack map, resolved commit refs, the template used per change (repo path or bundled default), local results, review passes, replies, repair commits, push/restack actions, per-PR check states, CI wall times, and any blocker (with its authoring exit code where relevant). Return every local project path created or materially rewritten during repair as `generated_files`. Keep any `.state` work Markdown within `essential:references/output-manifest.md`.
