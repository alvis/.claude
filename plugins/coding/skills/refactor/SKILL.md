description: Improve green code through behavior-preserving structural changes to organization, naming, readability, documentation, or redundant defensive logic. Use to remove meaningless helpers or internal runtime checks when existing tests pass and the requested outcome is maintainability rather than changed behavior.

# Refactor Code

Improve green code's structure, readability, naming, and documentation without changing behavior, keeping every test passing throughout. `coding:fix` owns failing code; `coding:write-code` owns new functionality; `coding:modernize` owns version-driven API upgrades.

<IMPORTANT>
Coherence Mandate: every edit must produce one continuous, deliberate work — rewrite over restructure, restructure over integrate, never append. A reader must not be able to tell which parts are new. That standard is why refactoring exists: it absorbs earlier compromises into the current shape of the code rather than layering niceties on top — and the Two-Stage Rule in step 2 is its concrete application to file size.
</IMPORTANT>

## Boundaries

- Use for: behavior-preserving improvements to structure, complexity, naming, readability, redundant helpers or defensive checks, JSDoc, and inline documentation on code whose tests pass. Supported behavior must stay unchanged; typed-contract violations by closed first-party implementations are not supported behavior.
- Do not use for: new features or business logic (`coding:write-code`), fixing bugs or failing tests (`coding:fix`), creating new test cases, or modifying project configuration. Reject when tests fail in the target area (fix first) or the area path resolves to no files.

## Inputs

- **Required**: `area` — path to the code to refactor.
- **Optional**: `--focus=naming|structure|redundancy|docs|all` (default `all`); `--from-composite` when invoked from a composite workflow.
- **Prerequisites**: all tests in the target area pass.

## Standards

Select `universal`, `typescript`, `function`, `documentation`, and `naming`, plus `file-structure` when creating or moving files. Apply each as a writer under `essential:directions/standards.md`.

## Workflow

1. **Analyze.** Parse the area and `--focus`. Run the existing tests; if any fail, reject and direct to `coding:fix`. Read the target files and list opportunities: structural improvements (extract functions, reduce complexity), readability enhancements, naming violations, missing or incomplete JSDoc, inline-comment gaps on complex logic, inconsistencies with established codebase patterns, and redundancy candidates. For redundancy, search for validate/assert/check/ensure helpers, schema parses, catch-and-translate blocks, and guards immediately after internal calls; these are candidates, not violations.
2. **Restructure** (focus `structure` or `all`). Apply design patterns per the standards, reduce function complexity, extract reusable helpers, and run tests continuously so no functionality breaks. When a file exceeds the project's `max-lines` threshold, apply the Two-Stage Rule before any ad-hoc split: Stage 1 — extract logic into another file as a genuinely reusable helper, preferred when more than one caller shares it; Stage 2 — if still over the threshold, split into the `<base>.ts` + `<base>/*.ts` folder pattern, keeping `<base>.ts` as a thin re-export/orchestrator and moving helpers into `<base>/*.ts` with short names (the folder provides the context). Never split into arbitrary sibling files (e.g. `foo.schema.ts`, `foo.parse.ts`) unless that naming is already an established project convention. The full rule and examples live in the coding plugin's `standards/file-structure/` under "Long-File Decomposition."
3. **Remove redundancy** (focus `redundancy` or `all`). For every candidate, trace all producers, callers, registration paths, dynamic loading, unsafe casts, and external inputs. Apply `GEN-SAFE-03`'s decision test. Retain guards at real trust boundaries and for conditions supported execution can invalidate independently. When a check only reasserts a postcondition of closed, typed, tested first-party code—even one the type cannot fully express—locate and cite the exact producer test for that postcondition, then remove the check and any helper, import, error mapping, or test made unreachable. Broad producer coverage is insufficient. If provenance is ambiguous or the exact test is absent, report the site without editing it; route missing producer coverage to `coding:complete-test` before retrying.
4. **Improve readability** (focus `naming` or `all`). Apply naming standards to variables, functions, and files; simplify complex expressions; improve flow and logical grouping; remove dead code and unnecessary comments.
5. **Document** (focus `docs` or `all`). Add JSDoc for all public functions, classes, and interfaces — parameters, returns, behavior, and `@example` blocks where appropriate — and inline comments that explain why, not what; mark known limitations with TODO/FIXME.
6. **Validate.** Run focused tests after each redundancy removal, then the full test suite with coverage, the linter, and the type checker. When a check fails, fix the cause and re-run that check; repeat until every check passes or a concrete blocker remains, then report the blocker instead of looping.

## Verification

- All tests pass with coverage maintained at its prior level; behavior is unchanged.
- Lint and type checks pass.
- Every removed runtime check has recorded producer provenance; no public, external, dynamic, unsafe, persistence, or deserialization path reaches it, and supported execution cannot invalidate the condition independently.
- Every removed producer postcondition check cites the existing test path and test name that proves that exact postcondition.
- Public APIs in the area carry complete JSDoc, and no file exceeds `max-lines` without a recorded blocker.

## Completion

Report the area and focus, files refactored, improvements applied with file:line entries, retained and removed redundancy candidates with trust-boundary rationale and exact producer-test evidence, JSDoc blocks added, naming fixes, and quality-gate results (tests, coverage, types, lint). Suggest commit via `coding:commit` when relevant. A partial result names the failing check and the blocker.
