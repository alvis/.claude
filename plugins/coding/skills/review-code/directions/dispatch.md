# Review dispatch contracts

Dispatch selected areas in one parallel batch, at most seven reviewers. Each reviewer receives only file paths and these common inputs:

- absolute active work root and assigned lowercase proposed-output identity;
- exact relevant spec/design/review paths from the mission capsule;
- canonical `plan_source: state.md` and applicable full `task_id` values read directly from `state.md`;
- discovered source/test/doc paths for the area;
- advisory mechanical-scan slice;
- [review.md](templates/review.md) and [mandates.md](references/mandates.md);
- instruction to modify no file, delegate no further, preserve stable finding IDs/statuses, and return complete proposed area content, counts, `context_level`, evidence, the unchanged plan source, and reviewed full task IDs for main-agent reconciliation.

The capsule is sufficient by default. Give `state.md` to alignment reviewers, or when resume/cross-slice evidence requires it; give `state/working.md` only when navigation is otherwise missing. Do not make every area reread both broad entrypoints.

Before dispatch, group discovered files by owning project, resolve every configured compiler-test discovery glob that applies to each group, then run the scanner once per group with that project's root and one repeated pattern argument per resolved compiler glob. Never combine files owned by different test roots in one invocation:

```bash
bun run plugins/coding/scripts/scanlib/core.ts \
  <files-owned-by-project> --category all --before 5 --after 10 \
  --test-root <project-root> [--test-pattern <compiler-test-glob> ...]
```

Surface a hard Bun runtime failure. Candidate output is not a finding until the assigned reviewer validates it.

## Areas

### alignment

- General-purpose contract analyst.
- Compare every changed behavior/file with root state's canonical task definition and criteria, materialized specs, approved work decisions/design, and relevant durable docs. Identify omissions, additions, unjustified drift, stale derivations, and missing promotion/sync work.
- If no approved work contract exists or its current task definitions differ from the review capsule, state that blocker; do not adopt root planning files.
- Follow an explicit implementation-detail link only for procedure keyed by existing IDs; reject it if it restates/changes IDs, edges, requiredness, targets, or acceptance mappings.
- Return proposed `reviews/alignment.md` content, prefix `ALIGN`.

### correctness

- Code-quality critic focused only on semantics.
- Trace control flow, boundaries, async/resource behavior, errors, operators, arguments, invariants, and plausible failure paths. Do not duplicate alignment, quality, or mechanical findings.
- Return proposed `reviews/correctness.md` content, prefix `CORR`.

### security

- Security champion.
- Check injection, authentication/authorization, validation, data/secrets, dependency exposure, CORS/headers, cryptography, and trust boundaries.
- Return proposed `reviews/security.md` content, prefix `SEC`.

### quality

- Code-quality critic focused on sibling consistency, non-mechanical redundancy, structure, naming posture, complexity, DRY, error-handling posture, performance, accessibility, and architecture. Route semantic bugs to correctness and plan drift to alignment.
- Return proposed `reviews/quality.md` content, prefix `QUAL`.

### testing

- General-purpose test-quality analyst.
- Check meaningful behavior/edge/failure/integration coverage, assertion strength, per-source coverage, isolation, determinism, fixture/mock ownership, complexity, and redundancy.
- Return proposed `reviews/testing.md` content, prefix `TEST`.

### docs

- General-purpose documentation analyst.
- Check exported API docs, complex-logic explanation, README/API/example/type accuracy, and whether durable architecture/design/spec promotion is required.
- Return proposed `reviews/docs.md` content, prefix `DOCS`.

### style

- General-purpose style analyst.
- Discover and run repository lint/format/naming checks, capture exact diagnostics, and report naming-policy gaps not already owned by tooling.
- Return proposed `reviews/style.md` content, prefix `STYL`.

## Reruns

If a reviewer fails or writes malformed output, redispatch that area only with the validation error and same inputs. Never ask another area to repair it.
