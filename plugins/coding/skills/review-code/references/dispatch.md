# Review dispatch contracts

Dispatch selected areas in one parallel batch, at most seven reviewers. Each
reviewer receives only file paths and these common inputs:

- absolute active work root and assigned lowercase output path;
- exact relevant spec/design/review paths from the mission capsule;
- canonical `plan_source: state.md` and applicable full `task_id` values read
  directly from `state.md`;
- discovered source/test/doc paths for the area;
- advisory mechanical-scan slice;
- [review.template.md](review.template.md) and [mandates.md](mandates.md);
- instruction to modify no reviewed code, delegate no further, preserve stable
  finding IDs/statuses, and return path, counts, `context_level`, and
  `generated_files` plus the unchanged plan source and reviewed full task IDs.

The capsule is sufficient by default. Give `state.md` to alignment reviewers,
or when resume/cross-slice evidence requires it; give `state/working.md` only when
navigation is otherwise missing. Do not make every area reread both broad
entrypoints.

Before dispatch, run:

```bash
plugins/coding/scripts/pyrun.sh \
  plugins/coding/scripts/scan_potential_violations.py \
  <discovered-files> --category all --before 5 --after 10
```

The wrapper resolves Python 3.13+ and may route repair through
`coding:sync-tool`. Surface a hard install failure. Candidate output is not a
finding until the assigned reviewer validates it.

## Areas

### alignment

- General-purpose contract analyst.
- Compare every changed behavior/file with root state's canonical task
  definition and criteria,
  materialized specs, approved work decisions/design, and relevant durable
  docs. Identify omissions, additions, unjustified drift, stale derivations,
  and missing promotion/sync work.
- If no approved work contract exists or its current task definitions differ from the
  review capsule, state that blocker; do not adopt root planning files.
- Follow an explicit implementation-detail link only for procedure keyed by
  existing IDs; reject it if it restates/changes IDs, edges, requiredness,
  targets, or acceptance mappings.
- Output `reviews/alignment.md`, prefix `ALIGN`.

### correctness

- Code-quality critic focused only on semantics.
- Trace control flow, boundaries, async/resource behavior, errors, operators,
  arguments, invariants, and plausible failure paths. Do not duplicate
  alignment, quality, or mechanical findings.
- Output `reviews/correctness.md`, prefix `CORR`.

### security

- Security champion.
- Check injection, authentication/authorization, validation, data/secrets,
  dependency exposure, CORS/headers, cryptography, and trust boundaries.
- Output `reviews/security.md`, prefix `SEC`.

### quality

- Code-quality critic focused on sibling consistency, non-mechanical
  redundancy, structure, naming posture, complexity, DRY, error-handling
  posture, performance, accessibility, and architecture. Route semantic bugs
  to correctness and plan drift to alignment.
- Output `reviews/quality.md`, prefix `QUAL`.

### testing

- General-purpose test-quality analyst.
- Check meaningful behavior/edge/failure/integration coverage, assertion
  strength, per-source coverage, isolation, determinism, fixture/mock ownership,
  complexity, and redundancy.
- Output `reviews/testing.md`, prefix `TEST`.

### docs

- General-purpose documentation analyst.
- Check exported API docs, complex-logic explanation, README/API/example/type
  accuracy, and whether durable architecture/design/spec promotion is required.
- Output `reviews/docs.md`, prefix `DOCS`.

### style

- General-purpose style analyst.
- Discover and run repository lint/format/naming checks, capture exact
  diagnostics, and report naming-policy gaps not already owned by tooling.
- Output `reviews/style.md`, prefix `STYL`.

## Reruns

If a reviewer fails or writes malformed output, redispatch that area only with
the validation error and same inputs. Never ask another area to repair it.
