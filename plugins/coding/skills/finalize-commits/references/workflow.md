# Per-Commit Loop as an ultracode Workflow (+ Mechanism B fallback)

Referenced from SKILL.md Step 2. Defines how the atomic per-commit walk runs as a dynamic Workflow when the `Workflow` tool is available, and the inline fallback when it is not. Per-commit procedure: `qa-loop.md`. All history mutations — folds, rewords, order surgery, and the final head move — are applied by `coding:commit`; publication is applied by `coding:write-pr`. This file only orchestrates.

## Shape

Strictly sequential walk, oldest-first, one commit at a time. One `model:'haiku'` agent per commit executes the FULL atomic seven-sub-step operation from `qa-loop.md` — replay, isolate, marker-check, gate, fold, reword, mark — inside a single dispatch; nothing is split across workflow steps or batched across commits. **The coordinator governs** — it owns every `pending_decision` and resumes the run. Sequential (not fanout) because each commit replays onto the previous commit's folded result and history rewrites must not race; N isolated installs of wall-clock is the accepted price of atomicity.

The walk chains the rebuilt head forward:

```
cur = stackBase                              # parent of the oldest target
for each target (oldest-first):
    result = haiku(qa-loop.md, cur, target)
    cur = result.newSha                      # the folded, marked commit
```

An abort at any position returns the last-good checkpoint (`refs/finalize/<run>/pos-N`; jj: the op log) and leaves the original ref untouched; the run is resumable from the checkpoint refs via `resumeFromRunId`.

## Two-gate pattern (order surgery is verified before QA is spent)

When the run includes order changes or hunk folds — Step 2's recommendation, applied by `coding:commit` after approval — they run as a separate surgery pass FIRST, before any per-commit QA:

- **Gate A — tip invariance, before any QA spend**: every order fix is an internal move, so the tip tree must be invariant. Verify `git diff <originalTip> <rebuiltTip> -- . ':(exclude)<lockfile>'` is EMPTY (jj: `jj diff --from <original> --to <rebuilt> --git -- '~<lockfile>'`). Non-empty means the surgery changed content — `coding:commit` rolls back; the walk does not start.
- **Gate B — after the walk, before the branch head moves**: the same tip-equivalence check against the fully rebuilt tip (only QA folds and rewords may differ), PLUS the lock fixed-point: run the project install at the rebuilt tip and verify `git status --porcelain -- <lockfile>` is empty — the tip's lockfile is already self-consistent. Only after Gate B passes does `coding:commit` advance the branch head (and `HEAD`/`@`) to the rebuilt stack.

## Mechanism A — Workflow tool

1. Build one step per target commit, each dispatching one haiku agent that runs the full `qa-loop.md` operation for that `<rev/sha>`, receiving `cur` and returning `newSha`.
2. A step returning `status: green` chains `cur = newSha` and advances the walk.
3. A step returning `status: pending_decision` **stops** the workflow and surfaces the `pending_decision` block to the coordinator.
4. The coordinator resolves it:
   - `test_fail` / `coverage_fail` → `AskUserQuestion` (fix now via `coding:fix` / accept / abort); on fix, re-run that commit's full atomic operation.
   - `semantic_conflict` → `AskUserQuestion` to decide the resolution (nothing was auto-merged).
   - `meaning_reword` → `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the type/scope change; on confirm, request the reword from `coding:commit`.
5. The coordinator resumes the workflow from the stopped step via `resumeFromRunId`; the checkpoint ref for the last green position supplies `cur`.
6. The run completes when every commit reports `green`; Gate B then clears the head to move.

## Mechanism B — no Workflow tool (fallback)

Drive the identical loop inline, with identical atomic semantics:

```
cur = stackBase
for rev in targets (oldest-first):
    report = Agent(model='haiku', task=qa-loop.md for rev onto cur)
    while report.status == 'pending_decision':
        decision = AskUserQuestion(report.pending_decision)
        apply(decision)            # coding:fix for code; confirmed rewords via coding:commit
        report = Agent(model='haiku', task=qa-loop.md for rev onto cur)   # re-run the full atomic op
    assert report.status == 'green'
    cur = report.newSha
```

Same governance, same stop/resume semantics — the coordinator blocks on each `pending_decision` and only advances when the current commit is green.

## Invariants (both mechanisms)

- One commit finalized fully — green + folded + marked — before the next begins; the walk never advances past an unfolded commit.
- No commit is marked while a `pending_decision` is outstanding.
- The branch head moves only after Gate B; mid-walk state lives entirely in the rebuild chain and the checkpoint refs, and a mid-walk abort leaves the original ref untouched.
- Every history rewrite routes through `coding:commit`, which guards it with its `backup.sh` + `verify.sh` pair; integrity failure rolls back and STOPs.
- Working-copy restore (`qa-loop.md` step 0 / final) is an unconditional exit obligation — every exit path, including aborts, ends with the WIP bracket removed; the original `@` (jj) is restored at the end of the walk.
