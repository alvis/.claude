# @theriety/platform — ARCHITECTURE

<br/>

ARCHITECTURE = how it works. For usage/install, see readme.md.

📌 **First paragraph:** This document is the **INDEX** for the `@theriety/platform` monorepo. The platform hosts three peer subsystems — **core**, **services**, and **sdks**. This file explains the cross-cutting shape, invariants, and onboarding path; the per-subsystem deep dives live under `docs/architecture/platform/` because the complete draft exceeded the final byte gate.

**Second paragraph:** The final Markdown batch found this architecture overview over 16,384 bytes, so coherent subsystem detail moved to lowercase children while this original path remained the cross-subsystem index.

### Why this split?

**Why 3 detail files?** The complete draft exceeded 16,384 bytes in the PM's final batch. The overview retains cross-cutting concerns; each coherent child goes deep on one subsystem. Multiple subsystems alone never force a split.

## 💡 Concepts

The monorepo leans on three cross-cutting abstractions that every subsystem honors:

| Concept | Role | Defined In |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Contract` | A Zod schema that declares a public interface; anything crossing a package boundary is validated against one | `packages/core/contracts/src/contract.ts` |
| `VersionPolicy` | Mapping from semver bump → allowed changes; enforced by `tools/release` so a patch never ships a contract change | `tools/release/src/policy.ts` |
| `DependencyTier` | Tier 0 is the floor (`core`), tier 1 is `services`, tier 2 is `sdks`. "Upward" imports — sdks → services → core — are forbidden by the import linter; downward imports are allowed. | `tools/lint-deps/src/tiers.ts` |

Contracts are the only artifact that crosses subsystem boundaries. Services and SDKs depend on `core`; they never depend on each other's internals.

## 🌐 Context

```mermaid
block-beta
    columns 3
    Apps["apps/*"]:3
    SdkBrowser["sdk-browser"] SdkNode["sdk-node"] SdkPython["sdk-python"]
    SvcApi["service-api"] SvcWorker["service-worker"] SvcScheduler["service-scheduler"]
    CoreTypes["core-types"] CoreContracts["core-contracts"] CoreErrors["core-errors"]
```

Apps consume SDKs; SDKs talk over the wire to services; services share contracts with SDKs via core. Core is the only subsystem every other subsystem imports; nothing imports upward.

## 🗂️ High-level Module Topology

```plain
platform
├── packages
│   ├── core      # see platform/10-core.md
│   ├── services  # see platform/20-services.md
│   └── sdks      # see platform/30-sdks.md
├── apps
└── tools
```

Subsystems are only expanded to depth 2 here; each part file expands its own subsystem fully.

`tools/` is private root infrastructure (linters, codegen drivers, release scripts) and has no dedicated architecture child.

---

## 🧩 Parts

| Subsystem | Responsibility | Part File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core` | Contracts, shared types, error taxonomy — zero runtime deps | [`platform/10-core.md`](./platform/10-core.md) |
| `services` | Long-running processes that implement contracts | [`platform/20-services.md`](./platform/20-services.md) |
| `sdks` | Client libraries published to consumers of the platform | [`platform/30-sdks.md`](./platform/30-sdks.md) |

> **Note**: In this bundled example the subsystem files carry an `.example.md`
> suffix for discoverability. In real projects the skill emits them as
> `docs/architecture/platform/<nn>-<subsystem>.md` matching the links shown here.

## 🧠 Cross-cutting Patterns

- **Monorepo tooling**: `pnpm` workspaces for linking, `turbo` for cached task graphs, `changesets` for versioning. Each tool owns one concern; none overlap.
- **CI strategy**: One pipeline per subsystem that gates on `turbo run build test lint --filter=...{subsystem}...`. A contract change fans out and reruns every downstream subsystem automatically.
- **Release train**: `changesets` accumulates version bumps; a weekly release commit runs `pnpm release` which calls `tools/release` to publish in topological order (core first, services next, sdks last).
- **Import linter**: `tools/lint-deps` fails CI when a `sdks/*` package imports from `services/*`, preserving the tier invariant.

### Release train

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Dev->>core: contract change PR
    core->>services: rebuild + type-check
    core->>sdks: rebuild + codegen
    Dev->>changeset: add changeset
    CI->>Registry: topological publish (core → services → sdks)
```

### CI gating per subsystem

| Subsystem | Pipeline | Gates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core` | lint → typecheck → test → build | 100% test coverage, no downward imports |
| `services` | lint → typecheck → test → integration-test → build | all public endpoints documented |
| `sdks` | lint → typecheck → test → size-check → build | bundle ≤ threshold, codegen fresh |

## 🛡️ Repo-wide Invariants

| # | Rule | Why | Enforced By |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | No upward imports across tiers | A leaf tier depending on a root tier creates release cycles | `tools/lint-deps` CI check |
| 2 | Every public symbol that crosses a package boundary has a Zod contract | Untyped wire formats break silently across SDK languages | `packages/core/contracts` review |
| 3 | `workspace:*` is rewritten at publish | Consumers must not see workspace-only ranges | `tools/release` `publish` phase |
| 4 | Every package README links to its durable architecture overview or relevant split child | Discoverability and split enforcement | skill audit step 8.w |
