# @theriety/platform — ARCHITECTURE: services

<br/>

ARCHITECTURE = how it works. For usage/install, see the subsystem READMEs.

📌 **First paragraph:** The `services` subsystem hosts the long-running processes of `@theriety/platform`: `service-api` (REST + GraphQL gateway), `service-worker` (background job runner), and `service-scheduler` (cron and delayed dispatch). Every service depends on `core-contracts` for its wire format and on `core-errors` for its failure vocabulary; no service imports from another service's internals.

**Second paragraph:** See the [INDEX](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for cross-cutting patterns and the sibling `core` and `sdks` architecture files. This document dives into the services topology, inter-service call flow, and job lifecycle invariants.

## 💡 Concepts

| Concept | Role | Defined In |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Handler` | A function that validates a request against a `Contract`, invokes domain logic, and returns a validated response | `packages/services/api/src/handler.ts` |
| `Job` | An enqueued unit of work with `kind`, `payload`, and `attemptPolicy` | `packages/services/worker/src/job.ts` |
| `Schedule` | A cron or delay expression bound to a `kind` that the scheduler resolves into `Job`s | `packages/services/scheduler/src/schedule.ts` |
| `Queue` | Shared durable substrate (owned by `@platform/queue`) used for inter-service communication. Services never import each other; all cross-service dataflow passes through the queue | `packages/services/*/src/server.ts` (consumer) |

## 🧩 Component Architecture

- **`Handler`** (`packages/services/api/src/handler.ts`): wraps a resolver with contract validation on both request and response; the only entry point for HTTP traffic.
- **`Dispatcher`** (`packages/services/worker/src/dispatcher.ts`): long-poll consumer that reads jobs off the queue and dispatches to the correct `Runner`.
- **`Runner`** (`packages/services/worker/src/runners`): one per job kind; implements the domain-specific work and returns a success/failure verdict.
- **`Resolver`** (`packages/services/scheduler/src/resolver.ts`): walks active schedules, produces `Job` records, and enqueues them for the worker.

## 🔄 Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Api as service-api
    participant Queue
    participant Worker as service-worker
    participant Scheduler as service-scheduler

    Client->>Api: POST /jobs (validated request)
    Api->>Queue: enqueue(Job)
    Api-->>Client: 202 accepted
    Scheduler->>Queue: enqueue(Job) on cron tick
    Queue-->>Worker: deliver(Job)
    Worker->>Worker: Runner.run(Job)
    Worker-->>Queue: ack or retry
```

The queue is the only shared substrate between services. Each service is horizontally scalable and stateless; durability lives in the queue and in the domain database owned by each runner.

### Sync vs Async

```mermaid

  A[Incoming operation] --> B{Response needs data?}
  B -->|yes| C[Synchronous handler]
  B -->|no| D{Work takes >2s?}
  D -->|yes| E[Enqueue async job]
  D -->|no| C
```

## 🔌 Extension Points

- **New API route**: add a file under `packages/services/api/src/routes`, export `method`, `path`, `handler`; register in `server.ts`.
- **New job kind**: add a `Runner` under `packages/services/worker/src/runners`, declare its contract in `core-contracts`, and publish the kind constant.
- **New schedule**: insert a row into the `schedules` table with a `kind` that matches an existing runner; the scheduler picks it up on its next poll.

## 🛡️ Invariants

| # | Rule | Why | Enforced By |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Every API request and response passes through `Contract.validate` | Untyped payloads silently corrupt the queue and downstream runners | `Handler` pipeline |
| 2 | A runner always returns within its `attemptPolicy.maxDurationMs` | Unbounded runners starve the queue and block other jobs | worker watchdog |
| 3 | Services never import from other services | Cross-service imports create hidden coupling and break independent deploys | `tools/lint-deps` |
