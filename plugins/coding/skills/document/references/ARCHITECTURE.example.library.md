# @theriety/retry

<br/>

📌 **Architectural shape:** `@theriety/retry` is a **pipeline library** — a tiny orchestrator (`RetryEngine`) drives a fixed 4-phase loop (`Attempt → Classify → Delay → Decide`), with each phase exposed as a replaceable interface. The codebase has zero runtime dependencies and splits into five narrowly-scoped modules that fan out from a barrel entry.

**Why this shape:** retries are deceptively hard because the decision is contextual — an error that is retryable for a background job may be fatal for a user request. By isolating the decision (`Classifier`), the wait (`DelayStrategy`), and the limits (`Policy`) behind thin interfaces, the engine can stay under 150 lines and the test matrix stays tractable. The public API (documented in the sibling [`README.md`](./README.md)) is the `retry()` function plus a `createRetryPolicy()` builder; everything else is an internal collaboration.

## 💡 Core Concepts

The four concepts below are the entire vocabulary of the package. If a contributor understands these, everything else in the source reads as collaboration between them.

| Concept | Role | Defined In |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Attempt` | a single invocation record; holds `index`, `error`, `durationMs`, `startedAt` | `src/engine/attempt.ts` |
| `Classifier` | pure function mapping a thrown value to a `Verdict` of `retryable \| fatal \| abort` | `src/classify/classifier.ts` |
| `DelayStrategy` | pure function returning the wait in ms before attempt `n + 1` | `src/delay/strategy.ts` |
| `Policy` | frozen bundle of `maxAttempts`, `maxElapsedMs`, classifier, delay strategy | `src/policy/policy.ts` |

| `policy` | `src/policy/` | express limits and wire the classifier + delay strategy | `Policy`, `createRetryPolicy` |
| `classify` | `src/classify/` | map unknown errors to typed verdicts | `Classifier`, `defaultClassifier` |
| `delay` | `src/delay/` | compute the next wait with optional jitter | `DelayStrategy`, `exponential`, `decorrelatedJitter` |
| `errors` | `src/errors/` | thrown aggregate and verdict types | `RetryError`, `Verdict` |

## 🧩 Component Architecture

`RetryEngine` is the only stateful component; every other piece is a pure function or a frozen record. The engine holds the `Policy` by reference and calls into the `Classifier` and `DelayStrategy` behind interface boundaries, which keeps the engine trivially testable with fakes.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class RetryEngine {
        -policy: Policy
        -attempts: Attempt[]
        -startedAt: number
        +run(operation, signal) Promise~T~
        -nextAttempt(error) Promise~void~
    }
    class Policy {
        +maxAttempts: number
        +maxElapsedMs: number
        +classifier: Classifier
        +delay: DelayStrategy
        +shouldContinue(attempts, elapsed) boolean
    }
    class Classifier {
        <<interface>>
        +classify(error: unknown) Verdict
    }
    class DelayStrategy {
        <<interface>>
        +nextDelay(attemptIndex: number) number
    }

    RetryEngine --> Policy : owns
    Policy --> Classifier : delegates to
    Policy --> DelayStrategy : delegates to
```

| Component | File | Role | Collaborators |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RetryEngine` | `src/engine/engine.ts` | orchestrates the 4-phase loop | `Policy` |
| `Policy` | `src/policy/policy.ts` | encapsulates limits + wiring; immutable | `Classifier`, `DelayStrategy` |
| `Classifier` | `src/classify/classifier.ts` | pure verdict mapping | `Verdict` |
| `DelayStrategy` | `src/delay/strategy.ts` | pure delay computation | — |
| `RetryError` | `src/errors/retry-error.ts` | aggregate error carrying attempt history | `Attempt` |

## 🔄 Data Flow

A typical failing-then-succeeding call walks through the engine twice before resolving. The sequence below shows attempt 1 failing with a retryable error and attempt 2 succeeding.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Caller
    participant Engine as RetryEngine
    participant Policy
    participant Classifier
    participant Delay as DelayStrategy
    participant Op as operation()

    Caller->>Engine: run(op, signal)
    Engine->>Op: invoke (attempt 1)
    Op-->>Engine: throw NetworkError
    Engine->>Classifier: classify(error)
    Classifier-->>Engine: 'retryable'
    Engine->>Policy: shouldContinue(1, elapsed)
    Policy-->>Engine: true
    Engine->>Delay: nextDelay(1)
    Delay-->>Engine: 120 ms
    Engine->>Engine: wait(120 ms)
    Engine->>Op: invoke (attempt 2)
    Op-->>Engine: resolve(value)
    Engine-->>Caller: value
```

## 🔁 State & Lifecycle

The engine is modelled as a small state machine. Every transition is driven by the outcome of the previous phase; there are no hidden states and no state that survives a `run()` call.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> idle
    idle --> attempting: run(op)
    attempting --> classifying: operation threw
    attempting --> succeeded: operation resolved
    classifying --> waiting: verdict = retryable & within limits
    classifying --> exhausted: verdict = fatal OR limits hit
    classifying --> aborted: verdict = abort OR signal fired
    waiting --> attempting: timer fired
    succeeded --> [*]
    exhausted --> [*]
    aborted --> [*]
```

## 🧠 Design Patterns

| # | Pattern | Intent | Implemented In |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Strategy | swap classification logic without touching the engine | `src/classify/classifier.ts` |
| 2 | Template Method | `RetryEngine.run` fixes the 4-phase skeleton; subclass-equivalent hooks are the injected strategies | `src/engine/engine.ts` |
| 3 | Builder | step-by-step `Policy` construction with sensible defaults and `.build()` freezing | `src/policy/policy-builder.ts` |

---

## 🔌 Extension Points

The most common extension is a new `DelayStrategy`. The interface is one method, all built-ins are pure, and tests are table-driven — adding one is genuinely three steps.

| Extension | Steps | Files Touched | Tests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Add a new `DelayStrategy` | <br>1. implement `nextDelay(index: number): number` in `src/delay/<name>.ts`<br>2. export from `src/delay/index.ts`<br>3. add a row to the delay table in `spec/delay/strategies.spec.ts` | `src/delay/<name>.ts`, `src/delay/index.ts` | `spec/delay/strategies.spec.ts` |
| Add a new `Classifier` | <br>1. implement `classify(error: unknown): Verdict`<br>2. export from `src/classify/index.ts`<br>3. add case rows to `spec/classify/<name>.spec.ts` | `src/classify/<name>.ts`, `src/classify/index.ts` | `spec/classify/<name>.spec.ts` |

## 🛡️ Invariants & Contracts

| # | Rule | Why | Enforced By |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | the engine never catches non-`Error` throwables | assertion failures and `AbortError` must surface immediately for debuggability | `instanceof Error` guard in `engine.ts` + unit test |
| 2 | a `Classifier` is a pure function of its input | caching verdicts and replaying attempt logs both rely on determinism | type signature `(error: unknown) => Verdict` + lint rule banning side effects in `classify/` |
| 3 | `Policy` is frozen after `.build()` | two concurrent retries sharing a policy must not see mutation races | `Object.freeze` in `policy-builder.ts` |
| 4 | attempt count is 1-indexed in public surface, 0-indexed internally | humans read logs, machines compute delays | adapter in `engine.ts`; spec fixture `spec/engine/attempt-index.spec.ts` |
| 5 | abort wins over every verdict | callers expect `AbortSignal` to be authoritative | signal check at the top of `nextAttempt` in `engine.ts` |

---

## 📊 Non-Functional Matrix

| Concern | Target | Strategy | Instrumentation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Performance | ≤ 5 µs engine overhead per attempt (excluding user op) | zero allocations in the hot path; `Attempt` records pooled per-run | `bench/engine.bench.ts` |
| Security | no eval, no dynamic require, no network access | zero runtime dependencies; pure TS | `npm run lint` + `npm audit --omit=dev` in CI |
| Observability | per-attempt records accessible after failure | `RetryError.attempts` carries every `Attempt` record | consumer supplies logger |
| Reliability | no unhandled promise rejections across retry boundary | `try/catch` wraps every phase; rejections funnel through `RetryError` | `spec/engine/rejection-safety.spec.ts` |
