## ⚡ Quick Start

Install the engine and a preset that matches your stack:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @acme/compose @acme/preset-node
```

Add a minimal `.composerc` to your project root:

```jsonc
{
  "preset": "@acme/preset-node",
  "config": {
    "tsconfig": { "compilerOptions": { "target": "ES2023" } },
    "eslint": { "rules": { "no-console": "off" } }
  }
}
```

Bootstrap your workspace:

```bash
npx compose bootstrap
```

Done. You now have a curated `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `prettier.config.js`, and `vitest.config.ts` — all driven from a single source of truth.

## 🏗️ Monorepo Structure

```mermaid
graph TD
  Core["@acme/compose<br/>(engine + CLI)"]
  IO["@acme/compose-io<br/>(filesystem + merge)"]
  Types["@acme/compose-types<br/>(shared types)"]
  Node["@acme/preset-node"]
  React["@acme/preset-react"]
  Lib["@acme/preset-library"]
  Eslint["@acme/plugin-eslint"]
  Vitest["@acme/plugin-vitest"]
  Docs["@acme/docs<br/>(website)"]

  Core --> IO
  Core --> Types
  Node --> Core
  React --> Core
  Lib --> Core
  Node --> Eslint
  Node --> Vitest
  React --> Eslint
  Docs --> Core
```

The repo is a pnpm workspace organised into four layers:

- **`packages/core/*`** — the engine, CLI, shared types, and filesystem helpers. Pure logic, zero opinions.
- **`packages/presets/*`** — opinionated, publishable bundles that compose plugins into ready-to-use setups (Node service, React app, library).
- **`packages/plugins/*`** — single-tool adapters (ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, TypeScript). Each owns its own merge logic and templates.
- **`apps/docs`** — the public documentation site built with Next.js, deployed from `main`.

## 🔍 How It Works

`@acme/compose` is a two-phase engine: **resolve** (load preset graph, merge configs) and **materialise** (write files to disk as symlinks or generated artefacts).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User as Developer
  participant CLI as compose CLI
  participant Engine as Resolver
  participant Preset as @acme/preset-*
  participant FS as Filesystem

  User->>CLI: compose bootstrap
  CLI->>Engine: load .composerc
  Engine->>Preset: import + resolve plugins
  Preset-->>Engine: { eslint, tsconfig, vitest }
  Engine->>Engine: deep-merge user overrides
  Engine->>FS: write generated configs
  FS-->>User: project ready
```

Presets declare _what_ plugins they need; plugins declare _how_ to build a config artefact. The engine handles resolution, merging, and file I/O — nothing else. This keeps the core small (~6 KB gzipped) and plugins independently testable.

---

## 🛠️ Usage

### Basic

Point `.composerc` at a preset and run `compose bootstrap`. That is the entire happy path.

```jsonc
{ "preset": "@acme/preset-node" }
```

### Advanced customisation

Extend multiple presets and override fields inline. Objects deep-merge; arrays concatenate unless you opt into `"$replace": true`.

```jsonc
{
  "preset": ["@acme/preset-library", "@acme/preset-react"],
  "config": {
    "tsconfig": {
      "compilerOptions": { "paths": { "~/*": ["./src/*"] } }
    },
    "eslint": {
      "rules": { "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "error" }
    },
    "vitest": { "test": { "coverage": { "lines": 90 } } }
  }
}
```

### CLI

```bash
compose bootstrap          # generate all config files
compose bootstrap --dry    # preview without writing
compose update             # bump preset versions safely
compose doctor             # diagnose drift between preset and disk
compose eject <plugin>     # materialise a plugin's config into the repo
```

## 🏢 Monorepo Development

Requires **Node 20+** and **pnpm 9+**.

```bash
# clone and bootstrap
git clone https://github.com/acme/compose.git
cd compose
pnpm install

# build all packages in topological order
pnpm build

# run the full test suite
pnpm test

# link the CLI locally for smoke-testing on another repo
pnpm --filter @acme/compose link --global
```

Useful filtered commands:

```bash
pnpm --filter @acme/preset-node test
pnpm --filter "./packages/plugins/*" build
pnpm --filter @acme/docs dev
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Does `@acme/compose` replace Turborepo / Nx / Lerna?**
No. It focuses on _configuration composition_. Pair it with Turbo or Nx for task orchestration — we ship a first-party Turbo integration.

**How is this different from `tsconfig/bases` or shareable ESLint configs?**
Those solve one tool at a time. Compose treats your entire toolchain (TS, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Prettier, bundlers) as a single composable graph, so a single preset update keeps everything consistent.

**Can I use it without a monorepo?**
Yes. A single-package repo works identically — just install the engine and a preset.

**What happens when I eject?**
`compose eject <plugin>` copies the generated file into your repo and removes it from the managed set. You own it from then on.

**Is it production-ready?**
We use it across 40+ internal repos at Acme, and it powers several mid-sized OSS projects. Semver discipline is enforced via Changesets.

**How do I write my own preset?**
See [guide/authoring-presets](https://compose.acme.dev/guide/authoring-presets). A preset is a package that exports a `PresetDefinition` — roughly 30 lines of TypeScript.

## 🌟 Philosophy

1. **Composition over configuration.** Every layer should be a small, replaceable function — never a monolith.
2. **Presets are code, not JSON.** Types, logic, and testability matter more than a clever config format.
3. **Drift is a bug.** If your preset and your repo disagree, `compose doctor` should tell you exactly where and how to fix it.
4. **The engine is small and stable.** Features live in plugins and presets so the core rarely needs to change.
5. **Boring defaults, bold escape hatches.** The easy path should be trivially correct; the hard path should always be reachable.
