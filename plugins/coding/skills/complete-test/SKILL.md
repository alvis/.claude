# Complete test

Own test authoring and test-suite maintenance. Do not implement production behavior, rewrite a failing application fix, or create placeholders for unspecified features.

## Boundaries

- Use for: pending test markers, coverage gaps, fixture restructuring, and test-suite redundancy cleanup within the requested scope.
- Do not use for: `FIXME` markers and production failures (`coding:fix`), production stubs (`coding:complete-code`), or new behavior without a testable contract (`coding:write-code`).

## Inputs

- Required: scope — files, package, feature, or explicit pending-test marker.
- Optional: framework and existing test paths. Coverage is fixed at 100% for statements, branches, functions, and lines in every selected runtime source file. Compiler-observable behaviors permitted by `TST-CORE-10` are eligible focused compile-time targets but do not participate in runtime coverage. Exercise them through representative consumer usage. Declaration shape alone — members, exact signatures or overload, predicate, or assertion inventories, schema fields, export inventories, and barrels — is ineligible; validate it with type diagnostics and affected-consumer builds. Executable runtime schema validators remain runtime sources and are tested with valid and invalid inputs through their supported parser entrypoints.
- Prerequisites: read project test scripts/configuration and the source under test before editing.

## State gate

Before creating or materially rewriting a project artifact, read the absolute `state.md` path injected by Essential. If unavailable, stop artifact writes and report the missing contract. Resolve the active work root first. The main-agent caller follows `essential:directions/establish-work-stream.md`: preserve an explicit user Work-ID override; otherwise select or derive the identity contextually, reuse a candidate only when its charter already owns the requested outcome, and rerun the resolver with the selected ID after `work_id_required`; never ask the user merely to approve an identifier. When delegated, start from the mission capsule's resolved Work ID/root and relevant specification, review, and evidence paths; if the resolver instead returns `work_id_required`, return its payload to the main agent without asking the user. Read `state/working.md` only when the capsule lacks current navigation; read `state.md` only for resume, cross-slice dependency, or alignment work. Never write main-agent-owned work pointers or overviews.

## Workflow

<IMPORTANT>
Classify the selected test work through the Coding workflow before choosing topology. Tier 0/1 bounded work stays with one test owner for authoring, focused checks, and self-review. Add an independent reviewer only when the change is consequential, explicitly requested for review, or publication-bound. Use coordinated multi-owner execution only for Tier 3, multiple dependent milestones, or genuinely independent slices too large for one bounded owner.
</IMPORTANT>

Load [./directions/orchestration.md](directions/orchestration.md) for the shared batching, per-test coverage-verification, redundancy-removal, fixture-restructuring, review, and report procedures. A batch is a verification unit, not permission to delegate it.

1. Resolve scope and classify each promise as runtime behavior, compiler-observable semantics, or declaration shape before inventory. Resolve the configured type-test mechanism and command for compiler-semantic targets; resolve a runtime-test and coverage mechanism only when eligible runtime sources exist. Group targets by owning project, derive each project's applicable discovery patterns from its configuration and conventions, including non-runtime filenames such as tsd's `*.test-d.ts`, and run the coding scanner separately for each group with its project root as `--test-root` plus every resolved compiler-test glob as a repeated `--test-pattern` argument; never combine targets owned by different test roots in one scanner invocation. Route runtime behavior to coverage batches, compiler-observable behaviors permitted by `TST-CORE-10` to focused compile-time cases, and declaration shape to type diagnostics plus affected-consumer builds. Exercise compiler behavior through representative consumer usage. Keep executable runtime schema validators in behavior-test batches and exercise accepted and rejected inputs through their supported parser entrypoints. Inventory the selected targets, current applicable tests, pending markers, fixture ownership, configured exclusions, and discovered compiler oracles; map every compiler-semantic target to any existing oracle before batching, and author a case only for an uncovered promise. Capture per-source and aggregate runtime coverage only when runtime sources are selected.
2. Partition independent runtime source/test pairs into coherent batches: 2-5 source files and at most 500 source lines per batch; put independent compile-time targets in separate focused batches of at most 10 target/resources each. The Tier 0/1 owner executes its batches directly. A qualifying coordinated run may dispatch disjoint batches in waves of at most 8, aggregating a wave before starting the next. Re-batch and retry incomplete runtime or compiler work. Serialize shared fixtures, global setup, snapshots, and integration state. Record both batch maps and completion so no target is skipped.
3. For every proposed case apply **test → measure → prove → keep**. For runtime behavior, execute a real implementation through a supported public entrypoint, add the smallest observable assertion, run its focused suite, and measure the intended source or branch. For compiler semantics, add the smallest representative consumer acceptance or rejection case, run the focused type-test command without invoking runtime coverage, and keep it only when it protects a behavior permitted by `TST-CORE-10`. Under `TST-CORE-02`, a case added for already-correct behavior must also fail under a temporary implementation mutation or equivalent controlled sensitivity proof, after which the implementation is restored and the focused case reruns green; record the proof and restoration. Delete cases that add neither distinct semantic evidence nor runtime coverage, and delete any initially passing regression case whose sensitivity was not proven. Never retain declaration/signature-shape or checked-in-content inventories.
4. Cover happy paths, meaningful boundaries, failures, and integration seams until every selected runtime source reaches 100% statements, branches, functions, and lines. Report uncovered metrics per runtime source; aggregate coverage cannot conceal a weak file. An instrumentation limitation is a blocker to report, not permission to lower the target.
5. Plan fixtures before changing them: identify consumers, lifecycle, mutation, and migration order. For a fixture rewrite, migrate every consumer, run focused suites, then the full suite. Do not leave old and new fixture systems in parallel.
6. Test redundancy cleanup by remove → measure → restore: remove one candidate, rerun focused tests and coverage, keep it removed only if signal and coverage are unchanged; otherwise restore it. Scope the coverage check to the test's mirrored source file: a test that contributes to its own source file's coverage stays even when globally redundant, and a test verifying a distinct behavior stays even when it covers the same lines as another. Never infer redundancy from similar prose alone; remove least-risky candidates first. Checked-in repository-content assertions are removed under `TST-CORE-10` regardless of coverage; replace their coverage only through consumer or generator behavior.
7. After each batch, run its focused runtime or compile-time tests and runtime coverage where applicable. If production behavior is wrong, route to `coding:fix`; do not edit source here. After all batches, run the applicable repository test, coverage, type, affected-consumer build, and lint gates; a compiler-only scope does not require a runtime framework, runtime suite, or coverage command.
8. Self-review the final test diff for missing behavior, weak assertions, fixture correctness, nondeterminism, and per-source coverage. When the independent-review predicate above applies, request one read-only final test review over the same scope. Apply justified test-only corrections. For every added or materially changed runtime or compiler oracle whose accepted baseline is green, repeat the `TST-CORE-02` sensitivity proof, restore the implementation, and rerun the focused case before rerunning the affected and full gates. When a gate fails, fix the cause and re-run that gate; repeat until every gate passes or a concrete blocker remains, then report the blocker instead of looping.

## Verification

Require passing applicable focused and full suites, 100% statements, branches, functions, and lines in every selected runtime source file, passing focused compile-time cases, and no remaining owned pending markers. Report topology, batches, files/cases added and removed, fixture migrations, focused/full commands, self-review and applicable independent-review results, compiler-semantic cases, aggregate metrics, and all four per-source runtime metrics. If any applicable gate cannot pass, report the concrete blocker and do not claim completion.

## Completion

Return a concise test report. Do not claim production implementation, bug fixes, or coverage for code outside the selected scope. Follow `essential:references/output-manifest.md` when writing eligible work Markdown, and return every created or materially rewritten path as `generated_files` to the main agent.
