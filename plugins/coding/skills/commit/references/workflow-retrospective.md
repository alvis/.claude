# `--retrospective` — distribute pending edits into prior changes

Single flag, three-stage execution. Subsumes the old commit-old `--retrospective` (git-only) and stack-code `--fix-up` (absorb-only). See [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md).

## When triggered

- User passes `--retrospective`
- `@` contains edits that logically belong in earlier mutable ancestors (typo fix, missed test case, comment update, etc.)
- All affected ancestors are UNMERGED on origin — else → [workflow-correct-merged.md](./workflow-correct-merged.md)

## Three-stage execution

The skill tries the cheapest mechanism first and falls through.

### Stage 1 — `jj absorb` (content-matching)

`jj absorb` automatically distributes each hunk on `@` into the nearest mutable ancestor whose context matches that hunk. This handles the common "I made a typo in commit C" case with zero LLM reasoning.

```bash
# Snapshot rollback handle first
jj op log -n1 --no-graph -T 'self.id().short()'

# Distribute all hunks
jj absorb

# Or interactively pick hunks
jj absorb -i

# Or scope by file
jj absorb path/to/file.ts
```

After absorb, check what (if anything) remains on `@`:

```bash
jj diff --stat
```

- Empty → success; proceed to mandatory follow-ups.
- Non-empty → Stage 2 for residue.

### Stage 2 — blame-tracing (for absorb residue)

For hunks that absorb couldn't place (typically new lines that lack matching context in any ancestor), trace each via `jj blame` and squash manually.

For each residual hunk on `@`:

1. Identify file and line range from `jj diff`.
2. Find the change that last touched the surrounding lines:

   ```bash
   jj blame @ <file> -L <start>,<end>
   ```

   Use the IMMEDIATE ANCESTOR of the new line in blame output — that's the change the new line conceptually belongs to.

3. Build a hunk→target map. Present to user for confirmation:

   ```text
   Residual hunks (3):
   - src/user/avatar.ts L42-58  → change abc123 (feat(user-profile): add avatar upload)
   - src/user/avatar.ts L60-71  → change abc123 (same)
   - src/auth/token.ts  L10-12  → change def456 (fix(auth): correct token expiry off-by-one)
   ```

4. Apply per cluster:

   ```bash
   # If all residual hunks for one file go to one target:
   jj squash --from @ --into <target> <file>

   # If a file's hunks need to split across multiple targets:
   jj split <file>   # interactive — separate the hunks into discrete changes
   jj squash --from <new_change_id> --into <target_a>
   jj squash --from @ --into <target_b>
   ```

5. After all squashes, `jj diff --stat` on `@` should be empty.

### Stage 3 — git fallback (rare)

Only when a target ancestor is a git-only commit NOT visible to jj (e.g. predates the jj-colocated init, or sits on a foreign branch jj can't reach). Detect via:

```bash
jj log -r <target_sha> --no-graph
# If "no such revision" → git-only
```

Procedure:

```bash
# Create a fixup commit pointing at the git target
git commit --fixup=<target_sha>

# Re-emit history with autosquash; suppress interactive editor
GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true git rebase --interactive --autosquash <target_sha>^
```

After git rebase completes, jj will see the rewritten objects on next op; run `jj git import` if needed.

## Hard rules

- EVERY target ancestor must be UNMERGED on origin. Per-target check:

  ```bash
  jj bookmark list -r '<target>::'
  # For each bookmark with a PR:
  gh pr view <bookmark> --json state -q .state
  ```

  Any `MERGED` → STOP, route to [workflow-correct-merged.md](./workflow-correct-merged.md).

- Conventional regex still applies if a target description is updated.
- Never amend descriptions silently — if a hunk's intent doesn't fit the target's description, surface to user.
- Stage 1 ALWAYS runs first. Don't skip absorb in favour of manual blame-trace; absorb is faster and more accurate when it works.

## Mandatory follow-ups

- Whenever any unmerged bookmark sits at or below a rewritten change, follow
  the [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) publication handoff with the resolved stack
  metadata after local integrity passes. The
  [`coding:write-pr` core publication workflow](../../write-pr/SKILL.md#3-publish-bottom-up) owns
  remote restacking, pushing, and PR-base repair.

- Integrity check ([SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) Verification) — the dual-checksum backup ensures the merged tree at `@` matches pre-state (since logically the same content lands, just redistributed across ancestors).
- Project scripts: `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build` for EACH affected change (check by `jj edit <change_id>` then build).

## Error / edge cases

| Symptom | Action |
|---|---|
| `jj absorb` rejects an ancestor (immutable) | That ancestor is on a protected revset; it's likely already merged → [workflow-correct-merged.md](./workflow-correct-merged.md). |
| All hunks remain after Stage 1 | Absorb found no matching context; proceed to Stage 2. |
| User disagrees with blame mapping | Re-cluster; allow user to override target per hunk; re-confirm before squash. |
| `jj blame` shows the change itself (`@`) | The hunk is genuinely new — it belongs as a new commit, not a retrospective. Surface and let user decide: keep on `@` and route to [workflow-save-local.md](./workflow-save-local.md). |
| Descendants conflict after squash | jj auto-rebases; resolve conflicts before final restack. |
| Stage 3 needed but target sha resolves in jj | You're in Stage 2 territory — re-run `jj log -r <sha>` to confirm; if visible, use `jj squash`, not git rebase. |
