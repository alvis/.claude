# `--reorder [--up-to <rev>]` — re-linearise history with content-equivalence guard

Deliver a clean linear chain up to a target rev, preserving the merged tree exactly. The user's hard requirement: **"ensure the content remain the same at the end"** — implemented via the dual-checksum guard in [verify.sh](../scripts/verify.sh). See [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md).

## When triggered

- User passes `--reorder`
- Optionally `--up-to <rev>` (default: `main@origin`; accepts `root` or any specific commit)
- Range to reorder is `(target..@)::`

## Procedure

### 1. Snapshot rollback handle

```bash
jj op log -n1 --no-graph -T 'self.id().short()'
```

Record the op id. `jj op restore <id>` rewinds the entire reorder if anything goes wrong.

The PreToolUse hook also fires `backup.sh` on the first rewriting op, capturing both `GIT_TREE_SHA` (git's `write-tree` of the working copy) and `CONTENT_HASH` (covers untracked files jj/git don't track). Both feed Step 5 verify.

### 2. Identify the range

```bash
# Default up-to:
UPTO="main@origin"
# Or explicit:
UPTO="<rev>"

jj log -r "${UPTO}..@" --no-graph
```

Confirm the user-visible list of changes that will be reordered. Capture each change's short id and current description.

### 3. Plan the new order

Apply [workflow-plan-structure.md](./workflow-plan-structure.md) layering: lower layers first, no forward references.

Present to user:

```text
Current order:
  abc123 feat(web): add avatar picker UI
  def456 feat(service): add upload endpoint
  ghi789 feat(data): add avatar field

Proposed order:
  ghi789 feat(data): add avatar field
  def456 feat(service): add upload endpoint
  abc123 feat(web): add avatar picker UI

Rationale: data → service → UI matches layering; each commit compiles standalone.
```

Wait for confirmation. On `--dry-run`, STOP here.

### 4. Apply the rebase

Two primitives. Pick based on shape:

**a. Sequential `jj rebase -s` chain (clean when the new order is a strict permutation):**

```bash
# Set the new base for the first change in new order:
jj rebase -s ghi789 -d "${UPTO}"

# Then walk the new order, rebasing each onto the previous:
jj rebase -s def456 -d ghi789
jj rebase -s abc123 -d def456
```

`-s` moves the change AND its descendants. If a change to move has unrelated descendants, use `-r` instead.

**b. Targeted insertion via `--insert-before` / `--insert-after`:**

```bash
jj rebase -r abc123 --insert-after def456
```

Use when reordering a single change without disturbing others. v0.40+ supports this. Verify with `jj help rebase`.

### 5. Content-equivalence guard

After all rebases, the merged tree at `@` MUST match the pre-state. Run:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/commit/scripts/verify.sh"
```

Read the `── Integrity Check ──` table:

| `GIT_TREE_MATCH` | `CONTENT_MATCH` | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| PASS | PASS | Reorder preserved everything | Proceed to Step 6 |
| FAIL | PASS | Git tree drift — reorder corrupted history | STOP, show `git diff <backup_tree> HEAD`, await user |
| PASS | FAIL | Untracked filesystem drift | STOP, show drift list, await user |
| FAIL | FAIL | Corruption | STOP, recover: `jj op restore <op_id_from_step_1>` |

The whole point of this guard is that `jj op restore` rewinds jj state but does NOT restore untracked files or build artifacts; the dual-checksum backup catches both.

### 6. Re-emit git refs

In a colocated repo, jj writes new git objects as rebases happen. Verify:

```bash
git log --oneline "${UPTO}..HEAD"
```

The git log should reflect the new order with the same descriptions.

## Hard rules

- Content-equivalence guard MUST pass before reporting success.
- ANY merged-on-origin change in the range → STOP, route to [workflow-correct-merged.md](./workflow-correct-merged.md) before continuing.
- Conventional regex unchanged (descriptions are preserved during reorder).
- Never use `git rebase -i` for reorder — jj owns the rewrite; git is downstream-of-jj here.

## Mandatory follow-ups

- If any unmerged bookmark sits inside the reordered range, follow the
  [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) publication handoff with the resolved stack metadata
  after local integrity passes. The
  [`coding:push-pr` core publication workflow](../../push-pr/SKILL.md#3-publish-bottom-up) owns
  remote restacking, pushing, and PR-base repair.

- Per-change build: `jj edit <each_change> && npm run build` to confirm each compiles in its new position.
- Final integrity + project scripts.

## Error / edge cases

| Symptom | Action |
|---|---|
| Rebase produces conflicts | Resolve with `jj resolve` or working-copy edits; `jj squash` resolutions into the conflicting change; re-verify. |
| `--up-to` rev not found | `jj git fetch`; confirm rev. |
| Content guard fails | DO NOT proceed. Recover via `jj op restore <op_id>`; replan the reorder. |
| Range contains merge commits | `jj rebase -r` instead of `-s`, or surface to user — merges complicate linearity and may need to be flattened first. |
| Target of `--up-to` is downstream of `@` | Error: range is empty or inverted. Re-check `jj log -r "${UPTO}..@"`. |
