# Pull-Request Changes: Violation Scan

Any violation is an issue that requires a fix. Use `write.md` for compliant
outcomes and load the matching guide from `rules/`.
Protocol: `essential:directions/standards.md`.

## Mechanical Scans

- `GIT-PR-SIZE-01`…`GIT-PR-SIZE-04` — Classify each exact base/head surface with
  [classify-pr-size.ts](../../skills/pr/scripts/classify-pr-size.ts) with Bun; never
  estimate a zone or reproduce its arithmetic.
- `GIT-PR-02` — Validate a rendered PR message with
  [scan-pr-message.ts](../../skills/pr/scripts/scan-pr-message.ts) with Bun, passing its
  selected template, exact head/base OIDs, zone, archetype, and generated
  paths. A nonzero result is a standard violation, not an authoring hint.

## Semantic Scans

Syntax alone cannot establish these findings.

- `GIT-PR-TYPE-02`…`GIT-PR-TYPE-05` — Inspect the implementation diff for public
  shape or feature prerequisite scaffolding stranded without its first
  implementation, migrations coupled to logic, mechanical changes hiding
  behavior, and files without a durable purpose or prohibited generated artifacts
  retained in the head. Deletions of prohibited artifacts are compliant. A declaration that is itself a complete type-level implementation and
  a standalone initialization whose requested result is the runnable or
  buildable baseline are complete rather than stranded.

Do not report commit messages, branch names, PR titles, draft state, labels,
stack position, history mutation, or merge order as standard violations. They
are directions in [coding:commit](../../skills/commit/SKILL.md) and the
[PR router](../../skills/pr/SKILL.md), and are process chores when unmet.

## Quick Scan

- DO NOT publish a PR message without Goal and behavioral Requirements or with
  invalid emoji/optional headings [`GIT-PR-02`]
- DO NOT misclassify generated paths or authored net LOC [`GIT-PR-SIZE-01`]
- DO NOT omit required Risk or Test plan evidence outside green [`GIT-PR-SIZE-02`]
- DO NOT omit a specific indivisibility rationale in red [`GIT-PR-SIZE-03`]
- DO NOT publish a black draft without its required message evidence or approve it without exact-revision OWNER authorization [`GIT-PR-SIZE-04`]
- DO NOT publish public shape or feature prerequisite scaffolding without the first implementation that fulfills or consumes it [`GIT-PR-TYPE-02`]
- DO NOT mix migrations with logic or omit migration rollback evidence [`GIT-PR-TYPE-03`]
- DO NOT mix mechanical refactors with behavior changes [`GIT-PR-TYPE-04`]
- DO NOT retain temporary files or generated artifacts except package lockfiles [`GIT-PR-TYPE-05`]

## Rule Matrix

| Rule ID | Violation | Bad Example |
|---|---|---|
| `GIT-PR-02` | Rendered message fails template scan | Missing behavioral Requirements |
| `GIT-PR-SIZE-01` | Wrong size inputs or zone | Generated path omitted from file count |
| `GIT-PR-SIZE-02` | Missing non-green evidence | Yellow PR without Risk |
| `GIT-PR-SIZE-03` | Missing red rationale | Generic or absent Why this size |
| `GIT-PR-SIZE-04` | Missing black evidence or approval gate | Approval without live OWNER authorization |
| `GIT-PR-TYPE-02` | Public shape stranded from first implementation | `ArchiveOrderInput` now; `archiveOrder()` later |
| `GIT-PR-TYPE-03` | Migration mixed with logic or missing rollback | Schema and business rule together |
| `GIT-PR-TYPE-04` | Mechanical and behavioral changes mixed | Rename plus new method |
| `GIT-PR-TYPE-05` | Temporary or prohibited generated artifacts | Generated client retained in the head |
