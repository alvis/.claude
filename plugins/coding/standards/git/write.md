# Pull-Request Changes: Compliant Patterns

## Key Principles

- Render and scan the selected PR message template.
- Classify size from the exact committed base/head diff.
- Keep public shape with its first implementation; separate migrations and mechanical work, and exclude temporary and generated artifacts except package lockfiles.
- Use existing feature-flag support when project rollout requirements call for it.
- Fix each violation in the implementation diff or rendered PR message that owns it.
- Follow [coding:commit](../../skills/commit/SKILL.md) for commit, branch, and local-history directions; follow the [PR router](../../skills/pr/SKILL.md) to load the selected authoring, stack, review, or merge directions.

## Core Rules Summary

### Rendered Message (`GIT-PR-02`)

- **GIT-PR-02**: Render the selected template without unresolved guidance, missing Goal or behavioral Requirements, invalid emoji/optional headings, missing evidence, unknown sections, or out-of-order sections.

### Size (`GIT-PR-SIZE`)

- **GIT-PR-SIZE-01**: Derive file count, authored net LOC, and zone with the canonical classifier.
- **GIT-PR-SIZE-02**: Supply Risk and Test plan evidence outside green.
- **GIT-PR-SIZE-03**: Supply a specific indivisibility rationale in red; an atomic public contract plus its first implementation remains eligible under `GIT-PR-TYPE-02` with the required stronger review evidence.
- **GIT-PR-SIZE-04**: Supply all black message evidence and require live, exact-revision OWNER authorization before approval.

### Implementation Composition (`GIT-PR-TYPE`)

- **GIT-PR-TYPE-02**: Ship public shape or feature prerequisite scaffolding atomically with the first implementation that fulfills or consumes it; a declaration that is itself a complete type-level implementation and standalone initialization whose requested result is the complete runnable or buildable baseline may ship without a runtime consumer.
- **GIT-PR-TYPE-03**: Separate migrations from logic and document rollback.
- **GIT-PR-TYPE-04**: Separate mechanical work from behavior changes.
- **GIT-PR-TYPE-05**: Require a durable purpose for every submitted file; remove temporary and generated artifacts except package lockfiles.

### Behavior Gating (`GIT-PR-STACK`)

- **GIT-PR-STACK-04**: Apply flags only in projects with implemented support; document flags changed by the PR.

## Canonical Outputs

- Author PR bodies from [message.md](../../skills/pr/templates/message.md), then run [scan-pr-message.ts](../../skills/pr/scripts/scan-pr-message.ts) with Bun and the exact head/base OIDs, zone, archetype, generated paths, and selected template.
- Run [classify-pr-size.ts](../../skills/pr/scripts/classify-pr-size.ts) with Bun against the exact committed base/head pair.
- Use each detailed rule guide for the smallest correction that makes the implementation diff or rendered message pass its mechanical and semantic scans.

## Anti-Patterns

- Treating a failed scanner as optional authoring advice.
- Estimating size or reproducing classifier arithmetic in prose.
- Calling a commit, branch, label, draft, stack, or merge operation a standard violation.
- Fixing a diff-composition violation with explanatory prose while leaving the implementation mixed.

## Quick Decision Tree

1. Authoring a PR body? Render and scan the selected message (`GIT-PR-02`).
2. Reviewing a diff? Classify its exact size (`GIT-PR-SIZE-*`).
3. Does the implementation strand public shape, mix migrations or mechanical work, or retain temporary or prohibited generated artifacts? Apply `GIT-PR-TYPE-02..05`.
4. Does the project have implemented feature-flag support? Apply its rollout requirements and document changed flags (`GIT-PR-STACK-04`).
5. Found a violation? Fix the owning diff or message and rescan.
