# GIT-PR-02: Render the Selected PR Message Template

## Severity

error

## Intent

A published PR message is a rendered instance of the selected template: the
bundled [message.md](../../../skills/pr/templates/message.md), or the
repository-local template that took precedence. It contains required evidence,
keeps included sections in template order, and never uses a placeholder as
required evidence. A bundled-template rendering also contains no unresolved
placeholders or author guidance comments. Every message states its Goal and
observable behavioral Requirements; generic process gates are not behavioral
requirements. Every heading has an emoji prefix. The authoring template marks
omittable sections with `[ Optional ]`; the final PR message removes that
authoring marker from every rendered heading. Verification names every
applicable standard, its green result, and supporting evidence for the exact
head/base revisions. Additional Notes retains the bundled template's visible
instruction to publish reviews separately from the PR description.

## Scan

Run [scan-pr-message.ts](../../../skills/pr/scripts/scan-pr-message.ts) with Bun and the
rendered body, selected template, exact head/base OIDs, PR-size zone,
archetype, and generated paths. Its violations identify this rule or the
conditional size, archetype, or stack rule that owns the missing evidence.
Semantic review still judges whether the supplied evidence is specific and
true.

## Fix

Re-render the body from the selected template. Supply every conditionally
required section from the change and remove empty optional sections. Strip the
bundled template's guidance comments and `[ Optional ]` heading markers,
preserve a repository template verbatim, then rerun the scanner. Do not patch a
failing body with a parallel summary or metadata section that the template does
not own.

## Edge Cases

- A repository-local template is scanned against its own heading order and
  remains verbatim, including its HTML comments, but it must implement the
  required section and heading contracts.
- Markdown headings inside fenced examples are content, not template sections.
- Passing the mechanical scan does not establish the truth or specificity of a
  Risk, rollback, test, or indivisibility claim.
