# GIT-PR-SIZE-03: Red Zone PR Size

## Severity

warning

## Intent

A red-zone PR changes **≤ 60 files** AND has **≤ 2000 authored net LOC** while exceeding yellow thresholds. Generated paths remain in the file count while their additions and deletions are excluded from LOC under `GIT-PR-SIZE-01`. Red PRs are allowed only when splitting would harm review: mechanical refactors, generated files, atomic migrations, or one public contract plus the first implementation that `GIT-PR-TYPE-02` requires to remain atomic. They require a concise, specific explanation of why the review surface is indivisible. The canonical PR template owns where and how that evidence is rendered. Red requires two confirmed independent-reviewer evidence triplets bound to the exact head/base OIDs.

The limits above are a human-readable projection of `../../../skills/pr/assets/size-thresholds.json`, the sole numeric threshold authority, and contract verification checks them against that asset.

## Fix

Author the PR body through the canonical template with a concrete indivisibility rationale and two reviewer triplets. Keep size counts, zone metadata, and review scheduling internal.

### Why this matters

- Without justification, a red PR signals an unsplit feature, not a cohesive change.
- Acceptable red-zone categories are narrow: `mechanical-refactor`, `migration` (atomic), `cleanup` (sweeping deprecations), and changes whose generated-file count crosses the red boundary despite modest authored LOC. One public contract plus its first implementation is also acceptable when `GIT-PR-TYPE-02` makes that surface indivisible.

## Edge Cases

- Red PRs that interleave behaviour changes with mechanical edits violate `GIT-PR-TYPE-04`; split before submitting.
- A red PR whose justification is only "feature too large to split" is a yellow-PR-shaped feature in disguise; re-plan independently shippable behavior through [stacked-prs.md](../../../skills/pr/directions/stacked-prs.md). Do not split public contract from its first implementation; when that atomic surface itself crosses red, explain the concrete `GIT-PR-TYPE-02` coupling and supply the stronger review evidence.
- Repository configuration cannot move the asset-defined band.
