# GIT-PR-TYPE-04: Isolate Mechanical and Behavioral Changes

## Severity

error

## Intent

Renames, file moves, codemods, formatting sweeps, and pure restructuring do not hide behavior changes in the same implementation diff. Reviewers may scan a uniform mechanical diff quickly only when its behavior is unchanged.

## Scan

Compare symbols, signatures, control flow, and observable outputs before and after the mechanical transformation. Report the rule when the diff also adds, removes, or changes behavior.

## Fix

Separate the mechanical transformation from the behavior change. Imports and references required solely by a move remain mechanical; signature, invariant, or control-flow changes belong to the behavioral diff. Use [stacked-prs.md](../../../skills/pr/directions/stacked-prs.md) to arrange the resulting changes.

## Edge Cases

- A formatter or lint autofix is mechanical only when it preserves behavior.
- A codemod needed to reproduce a uniform transformation belongs with that transformation.
- A latent bug discovered during a rename is fixed separately rather than hidden in the rename diff.
