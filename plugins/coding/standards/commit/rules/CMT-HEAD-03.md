# CMT-HEAD-03: Pair the Breaking Marker With Its Footer

## Severity

error

## Intent

`!` before the colon declares that consumers must change something. On its own it says a break exists without saying what broke or how to migrate, which is the part a reader needs. Every `!` is therefore paired with a `BREAKING CHANGE:` paragraph in the body describing the migration, and every breaking change carries the `!`.

## Scan

If the header contains `!`, require a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in the body. If the body contains that footer, require the `!`. Then judge whether the paragraph states the migration rather than restating that a break occurred.

## Fix

Add the missing marker or the missing footer. If the paragraph names no migration path, write one; if none exists, say so explicitly and name the replacement.

## Edge Cases

- A pre-release surface with no consumers is still marked; whether the version bump follows is the release process's call, not this standard's.
- In this repository, greenfield status permits breaking changes freely — it does not exempt them from being declared.
