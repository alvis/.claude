# CMT-SUBJ-01: Write an Imperative, Unadorned Subject

## Severity

error

## Intent

The subject completes "this commit will ...": imperative mood (`add`, `fix`, `rename`), never past tense. It targets 50 characters and never exceeds 72, so it survives every log format unwrapped. It carries no trailing period and no emoji. It is self-explanatory without the body, because most readers see only the subject line.

## Scan

Measure the subject in characters after the `: `. Check the first word for a past-tense form. Check the final character for `.`. Check for emoji codepoints. Then judge whether the subject alone identifies the change.

## Fix

Rewrite in imperative mood and drop the ornament. If the subject cannot fit 72 characters without losing meaning, the commit is too broad — split it rather than truncating the description.

## Edge Cases

- A proper noun or acronym keeps its natural capitalization; a lower-case first word is conventional but not enforced.
- The 50-character figure is a target and not a violation on its own; 72 is the hard limit.
