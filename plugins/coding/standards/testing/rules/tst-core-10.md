# TST-CORE-10: No Static Declaration-Shape or Checked-In-Content Pinning

## Intent

Tests protect observable runtime behavior or exactly these compiler-observable type behaviors: generic inference, generic-parameter default application when a representative consumer omits that type argument, constraint enforcement, representative contextual typing supplied by public callback parameters, representative assignability or substitutability, representative consumer-call overload resolution, representative control-flow narrowing through public type predicates, assertion functions, or discriminated unions, and conditional, mapped, indexed-access, `keyof`-driven, or template-literal type transformations exercised through representative consumer inputs and outputs. They do not mirror a declaration's exact inventory or a checkout's committed state: those assertions create a second source of truth that fails on legitimate edits without proving behavior.

The allowed compiler-observable tests are generic inference, generic-parameter default application when a representative consumer omits that type argument, constraint enforcement, representative contextual typing supplied by public callback parameters, representative assignability or substitutability, representative consumer-call overload resolution, representative control-flow narrowing through public type predicates, assertion functions, or discriminated unions, and conditional, mapped, indexed-access, `keyof`-driven, or template-literal type transformations exercised through representative consumer inputs and outputs. Exact declaration shape means a mirrored list of members, signatures, exports, schema fields, or re-export layout. A declaration's existence alone never requires a test; diagnostics and affected-consumer builds cover ordinary static compatibility.

This rule applies to every checked-in artifact, including source constants, manifests, configuration, documentation, hook payloads, templates, inventories, fixtures used as expected output, and generated projections committed to the repository.

<IMPORTANT>
Never pin an exact declaration inventory in a test:

- an exact type or interface member inventory;
- an exact generic-parameter or default inventory;
- an exact function signature or overload inventory;
- an export or symbol inventory;
- a schema declaration's field inventory;
- barrel or re-export layout and symbol identity;

Never assert these properties of a checked-in artifact:

- existence or absence;
- path or directory layout;
- file, field, entry, or identifier inventories and exact counts;
- bytes, hashes, sizes, text, literals, substrings, headings, or prose;
- parity with another checked-in artifact or preservation of a committed projection, snapshot, or golden output;
- schema validity, uniqueness, ordering, referential integrity, bounds, or any other systematic property of the checked-in artifact itself.

Do not recreate a removed repository-content gate under another test name, snapshot, fixture, or CI-only assertion.
</IMPORTANT>

## Allowed Boundary

A runtime implementation may be exercised through a supported public entrypoint. Assertions target returned values, state changes, emitted effects, errors, protocol messages, or fresh generated-result structure. Endpoint validation exercised through the endpoint is behavior; enumerating the endpoint schema's declared fields is static declaration shape.

A compiler-observable test may use `expectTypeOf`, compile fixtures, or the project's approved type-test mechanism only to protect:

- generic inference;
- generic-parameter default application when a representative consumer omits that type argument;
- constraint enforcement;
- representative contextual typing supplied by a public callback parameter;
- representative assignability or substitutability;
- representative consumer-call overload resolution;
- representative control-flow narrowing after a public type predicate or assertion function is called, or within a public discriminated-union consumer branch; or
- a conditional, mapped, indexed-access, `keyof`-driven, or template-literal type transformation exercised through representative consumer inputs and outputs.

No other type-test subject is permitted by this rule. An exact expected type is valid only when it is the computed or supplied outcome of generic inference or generic-parameter default application when a representative consumer omits that type argument, representative contextual typing inside a public callback call, representative consumer-call overload resolution, control-flow narrowing after a public type predicate or assertion function is called or within a public discriminated-union consumer branch, or a conditional, mapped, indexed-access, `keyof`-driven, or template-literal type transformation exercised through representative consumer inputs and outputs, not a copy of a standalone declaration. A representative call may assert its contextually supplied, resolved, or narrowed type; an inventory of callback parameters, overloads, predicate signatures, assertion signatures, or other signatures remains static declaration shape.

A checked-in artifact may be supplied as input to an actual consumer or generator. Assertions must be restricted to the behavior or freshly produced result; they must not restate which checked-in file exists, where it lives, or what literal content it contains.

Generated results created in memory or a temporary directory may be checked for schema, required fields, unique identities, ordering, referential integrity, count consistency, round-trip behavior, and deterministic generation. Missing, malformed, or stale input scenarios must likewise be created in a temporary workspace and exercised through the real consumer or generator.

Shared adapter or conformance suites are valid only when they execute each real implementation through its public surface and assert common behavior. The suite name "contract test" does not permit static-shape assertions.

Checked-in fixtures remain valid inputs to executed behavior. Expected-output mirrors are not valid oracles: derive structural expectations from the runtime result, schema, or consumer contract instead of comparing complete wording with a checked-in file.

## Decision Test

Ask what the assertion observes:

- **Generic inference, generic-parameter default application when a representative consumer omits that type argument, constraint enforcement, representative contextual typing supplied by a public callback parameter, representative assignability or substitutability, representative consumer-call overload resolution, representative control-flow narrowing after a public type predicate or assertion function is called or within a public discriminated-union consumer branch, or a conditional, mapped, indexed-access, `keyof`-driven, or template-literal type transformation through representative consumer inputs and outputs** — keep the compiler-observable type test.
- **An exact declaration inventory or module layout** — remove the test; run type diagnostics and affected-consumer builds.
- **A declaration merely existing** — do not add a test.
- **Checked-in repository state** — remove it.
- **Behavior produced by an executed consumer** — keep it when the behavior is distinct and meaningful.
- **A result produced by an executed generator** — keep structural assertions; remove exact wording or parity with a committed projection.

Reading a repository file inside a test is only compliant when that value is passed into the executed consumer or generator and every assertion targets the resulting behavior or output structure.

## Fix

1. Delete assertions that mirror exact member, signature, export, schema-field, or barrel inventories, plus assertions over checked-in existence, layout, bytes, literals, or parity; remove orphaned helpers and expected files.
2. Preserve or rewrite type tests only for generic inference, generic-parameter default application when a representative consumer omits that type argument, constraint enforcement, representative contextual typing supplied by a public callback parameter, representative assignability or substitutability, representative consumer-call overload resolution, representative control-flow narrowing after a public type predicate or assertion function is called or within a public discriminated-union consumer branch, and conditional, mapped, indexed-access, `keyof`-driven, or template-literal type transformations exercised through representative consumer inputs and outputs. Do not add tests solely because a declaration exists.
3. Run type diagnostics and affected-consumer builds for changed static public declarations.
4. If a consumer exists, exercise it through a supported public entrypoint with explicit input and assert the observable result.
5. If a generator exists, write into memory or a temporary directory and assert result structure, deterministic generation, or stale/missing-output behavior against that freshly generated result.
6. If no runtime behavior, generic inference, generic-parameter default application when a representative consumer omits that type argument, constraint enforcement, representative contextual typing supplied by a public callback parameter, representative assignability or substitutability, representative consumer-call overload resolution, representative control-flow narrowing after a public type predicate or assertion function is called or within a public discriminated-union consumer branch, or conditional, mapped, indexed-access, `keyof`-driven, or template-literal type transformation exercised through representative consumer inputs and outputs exists, deletion is the complete fix. Do not invent another repository-content property to retain the gate.

```typescript
// violation: the checkout is the assertion subject
expect(existsSync(join(repositoryRoot, ".gitignore"))).toBe(true);
expect(readFileSync(skillPath, "utf8")).toContain("required prose");

// violation: expected type only mirrors the declared member inventory
expectTypeOf<ArchiveOrderInput>().toEqualTypeOf<{
  orderId: string;
  reason: ArchiveReason;
}>();

// compliant: the assertion protects a generic operation's inferred result
const selected = selectFields(
  { orderId: "o1", reason: "duplicate" },
  ["orderId"] as const,
);
expectTypeOf(selected).toEqualTypeOf<{ orderId: string }>();

// compliant: omitting the type argument observes generic-default application
const defaultPage = loadPage();
expectTypeOf(defaultPage).toEqualTypeOf<Page<Order>>();

// compliant: representative public types must remain substitutable
expectTypeOf<ArchiveOrder>().toExtend<Order>();

// compliant: a representative public callback call protects contextual typing
visitOrder((order) => {
  expectTypeOf(order).toEqualTypeOf<Order>();
});

// compliant: a representative consumer call protects overload resolution
const loaded = loadOrder("o1");
expectTypeOf(loaded).toEqualTypeOf<Promise<Order>>();

// compliant: a representative predicate call protects consumer narrowing
const candidate: unknown = loadCandidate();
if (isOrder(candidate)) {
  expectTypeOf(candidate).toEqualTypeOf<Order>();
}

// compliant: a representative assertion call protects consumer narrowing
const asserted: unknown = loadCandidate();
assertOrder(asserted);
expectTypeOf(asserted).toEqualTypeOf<Order>();

// compliant: a representative discriminated-union branch protects narrowing
const result: Result<Order> = loadResult();
if (result.kind === "success") {
  expectTypeOf(result.value).toEqualTypeOf<Order>();
}

// compliant: representative inputs expose a mapped and conditional transformation
expectTypeOf<Serialized<{ at: Date }>>().toEqualTypeOf<{ at: string }>();

// compliant: representative inputs expose an indexed-access transformation
expectTypeOf<ValueOf<{ id: string; count: number }>>().toEqualTypeOf<
  string | number
>();

// compliant: the runtime schema accepts and rejects values through its parser
expect(archiveOrderSchema.safeParse(validOrder).success).toBe(true);
expect(archiveOrderSchema.safeParse(invalidOrder).success).toBe(false);

// compliant: generated output is the assertion subject
const outputPath = join(temporaryDirectory, "marketplace.json");
await generateMarketplace({ outputPath });
const output = JSON.parse(readFileSync(outputPath, "utf8"));
expect(output.plugins).toEqual(
  expect.arrayContaining([
    expect.objectContaining({ name: expect.any(String) }),
  ]),
);
```

## Edge Cases

- Runtime messages, error envelopes, exit status, and emitted JSON are behavior, even when their assertions contain literals.
- A temporary workspace may deliberately omit or corrupt a file when absence or malformed input is the scenario supplied to the consumer.
- Two implementations may receive the same generated input and have their results compared; this is runtime parity, not checked-in-file parity.
- `satisfies` and `as const` may encode source constraints beside declarations; type tests remain limited to generic inference, generic-parameter default application when a representative consumer omits that type argument, constraint enforcement, representative contextual typing supplied by public callback parameters, representative assignability or substitutability, representative consumer-call overload resolution, representative control-flow narrowing after a public type predicate or assertion function is called or within a public discriminated-union consumer branch, and conditional, mapped, indexed-access, `keyof`-driven, or template-literal type transformations exercised through representative consumer inputs and outputs.
- `ty:` is the canonical suite prefix for these compiler-observable type behaviors; its suffix is only the exercised symbol name, with scenarios in nested suites or test names. It does not imply that every type or interface needs a suite.
- Exact inferred, defaulted, contextually supplied, overload-resolved, narrowed, or transformed-output assertions are compliant when inference, generic-parameter default application caused by a representative consumer omitting that type argument, representative public callback use, representative call resolution, control-flow narrowing after a representative predicate/assertion call or discriminated-union branch, or computation is the tested behavior; copying a standalone declaration or enumerating generic parameters or defaults, callback parameters, overloads, predicate signatures, or assertion signatures is not.
- A runtime schema parser may be tested by parsing valid and invalid values; assertions over the schema's declared field inventory are forbidden.
- A shared conformance suite may execute multiple real adapters and assert the same results or effects; a suite that only checks their signatures is forbidden.
- Coverage contribution cannot redeem a repository-content assertion. Replace it with consumer or generator coverage, or accept the uncovered static data.
- Barrel re-export identity assertions test checked-in module layout and must be removed.
