# Coding

General code production: writing, fixing, refactoring, testing, linting,
documenting, and publishing code with history you can trust. Depends on
`essential`. Every workflow follows the engineering-work contract — worker
skills return evidence and manifests; the coordinator reconciles state.

## History safety

Two mechanisms make saves and publication safe around AI-driven edits:

- **Scoped saves.** Lifecycle saves run through `coding:commit` with a sealed
  path manifest (`--paths-from=<manifest> --manifest-sha256=<sha>`), so a
  save touches exactly the reviewed file set and preserves unrelated staged
  or dirty developer work. Any writer after sealing invalidates the manifest.
- **Per-commit QA.** `coding:finalize-commits` verifies every unpushed commit
  in isolation before `coding:push-pr` publishes draft PRs and drives CI to
  green. History mutation belongs to `coding:commit` alone.

## Skills

| Skill | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| `coding:write-code` | New functions, features, modules, or endpoints via a TDD lifecycle. |
| `coding:draft-code` | Typed skeletons with canonical `TODO(implementation)` placeholders. |
| `coding:complete-code` | Completing explicit production stubs and draft sentinels. |
| `coding:complete-test` | Test TODOs, coverage gaps, fixtures, redundancy cleanup. |
| `coding:fix` | Diagnosed failures: broken tests, type errors, lint failures, red CI. |
| `coding:refactor` | Behavior-preserving structural improvement of green code. |
| `coding:modernize` | Version-supported syntax/API upgrades. |
| `coding:lint` | Mechanical standards enforcement over a selected scope. |
| `coding:review-code` | Post-implementation / pre-merge review into canonical review artifacts. |
| `coding:document` | Source-backed package and architecture docs after meaningful changes. |
| `coding:commit` | All history mutation: scoped saves, split/absorb, stacking, reordering. |
| `coding:finalize-commits` | Isolated per-commit QA before publishing a stack. |
| `coding:push-pr` | Draft-PR publication and CI babysitting. |
| `coding:write-pr` | Conventional-commit PR title/body from a change ref. |
| `coding:merge-pr` | Bottom-up merging of a linear PR stack with restacks. |
| `coding:setup-project` | Project/monorepo scaffolding when structure is missing. |
| `coding:cleanup` | Evidence-based retirement of stale branches, worktrees, and work dirs. |
| `coding:find-unused` | Read-only dead-code discovery. |
| `coding:sync-tool` | Installing/updating registered CLI tools (brew, jj, gh, …). |

`constitution/standards/` carries the language and workflow standards
(TypeScript, Python, Rust, git, naming, testing, documentation) that `lint`
and reviewers enforce; other plugins (react, web) route their own standards
through the same executors.
