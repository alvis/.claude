# Work Handover Documentation

Generates comprehensive handover documentation capturing current project & work context across three complementary files: CONTEXT.md (status & decisions), RESEARCH.md (documentation & learnings), and PLAN.md (goals & tasks) for seamless project continuation without requiring prior context

## 🎯 Purpose & Scope

**What this command does NOT do**:

- Does not perform git operations like commit, push, or branch management
- Does not execute project builds, tests, or deployments
- Does not analyze code quality or perform code reviews
- Does not modify any project files except the handover documents themselves
- Does not replace project management tools or issue tracking systems

**When to REJECT**:

- When file path argument points to non-markdown files
- When requested to perform git operations instead of documentation
- When asked to modify project source code
- When the working directory is not a git repository
- When user requests code analysis instead of handover documentation

- Untracked files: !`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`

## 🔄 Workflow

ultrathink: Before performing any steps, deeply analyze the complete project context:

- **Project State Analysis**: Examine git status, recent commits, file changes to understand current work trajectory
- **Existing Work Review**: Read all current todos from TodoRead to understand ongoing tasks and their status
- **Context Discovery**: Identify background, goals, decisions from project docs and commit history
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detect architectural patterns, established conventions, recurring issues
- **Comprehensive Synthesis**: Integrate all gathered context into coherent handover documentation

Then perform the following steps:

### Step 1: Parse Arguments and Validate

- Extract the --files argument from $ARGUMENTS
- If no --files provided, use empty prefix (default files: CONTEXT.md, RESEARCH.md, PLAN.md)
- If --files=prefix provided, extract prefix (generates: prefix-CONTEXT.md, prefix-RESEARCH.md, prefix-PLAN.md)
- Validate that all three file paths will end with .md extension
- Verify the working directory is a git repository
- If validation fails, reject with clear error message

**File naming examples**:

- Default: `CONTEXT.md`, `RESEARCH.md`, `PLAN.md`

### Step 2: Discover Project Context

- Use TodoRead to retrieve all existing todos from the task tracker
- Organize todos by status for inclusion in PLAN.md:
- Preserve task relationships and dependencies if indicated in task content
- Note any context or patterns from task descriptions
- Run git commands to gather current state (branch, status, recent commits)
- Capture recent commit messages for context on what was done

### Step 3: Classify File Status

Classify each file into one of three categories with detailed substates:

- **✅ Completed**: Files that are committed and unchanged (not in git status output)
- **🚧 In Progress**: Files that are modified or staged (in git diff or git diff --cached), with substates:
  - `need-completion`: Files with TODO/FIXME comments indicating incomplete implementation
  - `need-fixing`: Files with test failures, errors, or HACK/WORKAROUND comments
  - `need-linting`: Files with linting/formatting issues or style violations
  - `need-refactoring`: Files with REFACTOR comments or code quality concerns
- **📋 Planned**: Untracked files or files mentioned in TODO comments, with substates:
  - `need-draft`: Untracked files or files with mostly TODOs requiring initial skeleton
  - `need-testing`: Files without corresponding test files or lacking test coverage

For each file, gather:

- File path and type
- Current status with substate (e.g., "🚧 need-completion", "📋 need-draft")
- Relevant TODO/FIXME/REFACTOR comments if present
- Brief description of what specifically needs to be done
- Any blockers or dependencies

### Step 4: Extract Key Information and Apply Intelligent Pruning

When updating existing handover files, apply intelligent pruning to keep documentation focused and actionable:

**Pruning Rules**:

- Keep only last 5 commits in "Recent Changes" (archive older commits to Historical Notes)
- Condense completed files into summary statements (e.g., "15 files completed" with top 3-5 listed)
- Rewrite sections exceeding 100 lines to focus on actionable items only
- Consolidate similar gotchas/decisions into single entries
- Remove detailed descriptions of completed tasks (keep file path + brief summary only)
- Archive verbose historical content to "Historical Notes" section at document bottom
- Remove outdated context that no longer affects current work

Search for and document (with pruning applied):

**For CONTEXT.md**:

- Background & context - why this work is being done (concise, actionable only; remove outdated context)
- Goals & objectives - current goals only (remove completed goals)
- Reference documents - active/relevant links only (remove stale links)
- Important decisions made - recent and impactful only (consolidate similar decisions)
- Architectural patterns used - current patterns only (remove deprecated patterns)
- Gotchas and workarounds - consolidate similar items
- Dependencies added or modified - recent changes only
- Configuration changes - current config only (remove historical config)

**For RESEARCH.md**:

- Documentation URLs - active references only (remove obsolete docs)
- Stack Overflow/GitHub issue links - still relevant only
- API documentation references - current API versions
- Problems encountered - consolidate similar problems
- Solutions applied - keep distinct solutions (merge duplicates)
- Exploration attempts - keep failures only if still relevant
- Insights and discoveries - merge similar insights
- Open questions - current questions only (remove answered)
- What approaches worked - distinct approaches only
- What approaches didn't work - keep if relevant to future work

**For PLAN.md**:

- Goals breakdown - current goals
- Task lists - incomplete tasks only, archive completed
- Phases/milestones - active phases (archive completed)
- Dependencies - current dependencies only
- Decisions made - impactful decisions only
- Risks identified - active risks only
- Success criteria - unmet criteria only
- Current todos - actionable items only
- Task progress - incomplete tasks focus
- Pending work items - prioritized items

### Step 5: Generate or Update Handover Documents

**First, generate current timestamp**:

- Execute: `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` to get current ISO 8601 timestamp
- Store the result to use consistently across all documents
- Use this actual timestamp (not placeholders) for all "Last Updated", "Created", "Updated" fields

If the files exist:

- Read the existing content of each file
- Update the "Last Updated" timestamp with the actual current timestamp from `date` command
- Refresh dynamic sections (Current State, File Status, Recent Changes)
- Append new items where appropriate
- Preserve historical content

If the files don't exist:

- Create new documents with complete structure for all three files
- Use actual timestamp from `date` command for all timestamp fields

**CONTEXT.md Structure**:

Note: All dates and timestamps in CONTEXT.md must use ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
Generate timestamp with: `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`

```markdown
# Work Handover - [Project Name]

**Last Updated**: [Use actual timestamp from `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`]
**Current Branch**: [branch name]
**Working Directory**: [pwd]

## 📝 Examples

### Simple Usage

```bash
/handover
# Creates 3 files with current project state:
# - CONTEXT.md: Status, files, decisions
# - RESEARCH.md: References, problems/solutions, insights
# - PLAN.md: Goals, tasks
```

### Custom File Prefix

```bash
/handover --files=sprint1
# Creates or updates:
# - sprint1-CONTEXT.md: Current status and decisions
# - sprint1-RESEARCH.md: Research and learnings
# - sprint1-PLAN.md: Goals and task breakdown
```

### Update Existing

```bash
/handover
# If files exist, updates them with:
# - New timestamp
# - Refreshed current state
# - Updated file classifications
# - New recent changes appended
```

### Error Case Handling

```bash
/handover --files=tasks.txt
# Error: Handover files must be markdown files (.md extension)
# Suggestion: Use '/handover --files=sprint1' or '/handover' for default

/handover
# Error: Not a git repository
# Suggestion: Initialize git with 'git init' or navigate to a git repository
```

### Three-File Workflow

After running /handover, three complementary files work together:

**1. Read CONTEXT.md first** → Understand current status

- What files are done/in-progress/planned
- Key decisions made
- Gotchas to watch out for

**2. Read RESEARCH.md second** → Learn from research

- Documentation already consulted
- Problems already solved
- What approaches worked/failed

**3. Read PLAN.md third** → Know the path forward

- Overall goals and success criteria
- Task breakdown by phase
- Dependencies

This trio provides complete project understanding for seamless continuation.

### Continuation Scenario

The /takeover command automatically reads all three handover files to provide complete project understanding for seamless continuation:

- **CONTEXT.md**: Current status verification, file states, decisions, and gotchas
- **RESEARCH.md**: Research insights to avoid re-work and failed approaches
- **PLAN.md**: Prioritized task list and clear path forward
