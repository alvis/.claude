# Fix Test

Fixes issues in test files including incorrect behavior, standards violations, type safety problems, and other test-related issues while preserving test intent and correctness. Focuses on fixing test behavior rather than making tests pass.

## 🎯 Purpose & Scope

**What this command does NOT do**:

- Modify source code under test to make failing tests pass  
- Create new tests from scratch
- Run test suites for general health checks
- Modify non-test files or production code

**When to REJECT**:

- Request asks to modify source code to fix failing tests
- User wants to create entirely new test files
- Request is about running tests rather than fixing existing test code
- Changes would compromise test correctness or intent

## 📝 Examples

### Simple Usage

```bash
/fix-test "user.spec.ts"
# Fixes issues in specific test file with standards compliance
```

### Directory-based Usage

```bash
/fix-test "src/components/"
# Fixes issues in all test files within the components directory
```

### Complex Usage with Changes

```bash
/fix-test "auth.spec.ts" --changes="Fix mock implementation and update assertion logic"
# Fixes specific test file with targeted changes described
```

### Multiple Files Usage

```bash
/fix-test "*.spec.ts"
# Fixes issues in all test files matching the pattern
```

### Error Case Handling

```bash
/fix-test "nonexistent.spec.ts"
# Error: Test file not found
# Suggestion: Check available test files with 'find . -name "*.spec.ts"'
# Alternative: Use '/fix-test "src/"' to scan directory for test files
```

### Complex Directory Structure

```bash
/fix-test "src/services/" --changes="Update mocks to match new API interface"
# Fixes all test files in services directory with specific focus on mock updates
# Automatically delegates to:
#   - Agent A: Handles test files batch 1 (≤10 files)
#   - Agent B: Handles test files batch 2 (≤10 files)
#   - Agent C: Handles fixture/mock corrections (after test fixes complete)
```

### Standards Compliance Fix

```bash
/fix-test "integration/"
# Fixes all test files in integration directory for full standards compliance
# Applies testing, TypeScript, and documentation standards
# Discovers and applies additional relevant standards automatically
```
