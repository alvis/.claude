```

### Commit Types

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix

- `chore` - Routine tasks/dependencies
- `revert` - Revert previous commit

### Commit Rules

- **Scope**: directory/module (optional)
- **Summary**: Present tense, imperative mood
- **Reference issues**: `(#123)`
- **Footer**: `Closes #123, #456`

### Commit Examples

```bash
