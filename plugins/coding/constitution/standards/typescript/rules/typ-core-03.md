# TYP-CORE-03: No Type-Escape Casting in Production

## Intent

Type-escape casts are forbidden in production code, including `as unknown as TYPE` and `as never`. Fix the type model or add guard-based narrowing.

## Fix

```typescript
// type guard instead of casting
function isUser(value: unknown): value is User {
  return typeof value === "object" && value !== null && "id" in value && "name" in value;
}

if (!isUser(data)) throw new ValidationError("Invalid user data");
const user = data; // TypeScript knows this is User
```

### Why `as unknown as TYPE` Is Dangerous

1. **No validation**: Bypasses all type checking -- the data could be anything
2. **Runtime errors**: Creates false confidence in type safety
3. **Hidden bugs**: Type mismatches only discovered at runtime
4. **Defeats TypeScript**: Makes the type system useless

### Refactoring Alternatives

When tempted to use `as unknown as TYPE`:

1. **Analyze** why the types do not match
2. **Root cause** -- Identify the actual issue:
   - Incorrect type definitions?
   - Missing type guards?
   - Wrong function signature?
   - Data structure mismatch?
3. **Fix properly** using one of these solutions:
   - Create type guards with runtime validation
   - Refactor data structures to match types
   - Update type definitions to reflect reality
   - Add proper validation at boundaries

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: double casting defeats type safety
const user = data as unknown as User; // no validation!

// ✅ GOOD: use type guards for safe type narrowing
function isUser(value: unknown): value is User {
  return (
    typeof value === "object" &&
    value !== null &&
    "id" in value &&
    "name" in value
  );
}

if (!isUser(data)) {
  throw new ValidationError("Invalid user data");
}
const user = data; // TypeScript knows this is safe

// ✅ GOOD: refactor to fix type issues
interface ApiResponse {
  user: User;
  metadata: ResponseMetadata;
}
const response: ApiResponse = await fetchUser(); // proper typing
const user = response.user;
```

### Testing-Only Exception

Testing partial-cast chains are allowed only in test files. See `TYP-TYPE-07` for the acceptable patterns.

## Edge Cases

- When existing code matches prior violation patterns such as ❌ `value as unknown as User`, refactor before adding new behavior.
- If types mismatch, fix schema/type contracts first; use testing exception path only in test files with explicit partial-type validation.
