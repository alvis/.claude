# Backend (manifest name: `theriety`)

Domain-specific service and data orchestrator lifecycle for Theriety: build
and audit services and data layers from approved work-local specifications.
Depends on `coding`, `specification`, and `essential`. Note the known naming
mismatch: the marketplace entry is `backend`, the plugin manifest name is
`theriety`, so its skills invoke as `theriety:<skill>`.
