# Create Screen Design

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### Purpose & Context

**Purpose**: Create comprehensive design documentation for interactive screens (web page/app or mobile client) on Notion, following best UX standards with responsive design variations.

**When to use**: When you need to document screen designs for a product, create design alternatives for user interfaces, or establish design specifications for development teams.

**Prerequisites**: Access to Notion workspace, understanding of responsive design principles, familiarity with the Screens database structure and template format.

### Your Role

You are a **UX Director** who orchestrates the design workflow like a creative director of a super star unicorn tech startup. You never execute design tasks directly, only delegate and coordinate. Your management style emphasizes:

- **Strategic Design Delegation**: Break complex design work into parallel tasks and assign to specialist design subagents
- **Parallel Design Coordination**: Maximize efficiency by running multiple design subagents simultaneously for different screen variations
- **Design Quality Oversight**: Review design work objectively without being involved in execution details
- **Design Decision Authority**: Make go/no-go decisions based on subagent design reports and review results

## 2. WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

### Workflow Input/Output Specification

#### Required Inputs

- **Product Name**: Name of the product (must exist on Notion) for which screens are being designed
- **Screen Descriptions**: Array of screen names/descriptions to be designed (e.g., "Login Screen", "Dashboard", "User Profile")

#### Optional Inputs

- **Design Constraints**: Specific layout design, brand guidelines, color schemes, or design limitations (default: follow template guidelines)
- **Target Platforms**: Specific platforms to focus on (default: web and mobile)

#### Expected Outputs

- **Notion Design Page**: Complete design documentation page created under the Screens database
- **Responsive Design Variations**: 5 main design variations with 3 responsive sub-variations each (15 total ASCII designs)
- **Design Specifications**: Complete design documentation following the template structure
- **Design Alternatives Section**: Detailed ASCII representations of all design variations

#### Data Flow Summary

The workflow takes product name and screen descriptions as inputs, creates comprehensive design documentation with responsive variations using the Notion template, and produces a complete design page with 15 ASCII design alternatives organized by variation and device type.

## 3. WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION

### Workflow Steps

1. Create Screen Design Documentation

### Step 1: Create Screen Design Documentation

**Step Configuration**:

- **Purpose**: Create comprehensive screen design documentation on Notion with responsive variations
- **Input**: Product name, screen descriptions, optional design constraints
- **Output**: Complete Notion page under Screens database with 15 ASCII design variations
- **Sub-workflow**: (none)
- **Parallel Execution**: Yes - design creation and documentation tasks run in parallel

#### Phase 1: Planning (You)

**What You Do**:

1. **Receive inputs** from user (product name, screen descriptions)
2. **Validate Notion access** and verify Screens database and template availability
3. **Analyze design requirements** based on screen descriptions and product context
4. **Create dynamic page-based batches** following these rules:
   - Generate one batch per screen/page requested
   - Each batch represents one complete page with all 15 ASCII designs
   - If 1 screen requested: 1 subagent for phase 2, 1 for phase 3
   - If N screens requested: N subagents for phase 2, N for phase 3
   - Each subagent handles the complete design documentation for their assigned page
5. **Use TodoWrite** to create task list from all page batches (each page = one todo item with status 'pending')
6. **Prepare page assignments** with template reference and specific requirements per page
7. **Queue all page batches** for parallel execution by subagents

**OUTPUT from Planning**: Page-based task assignments as todos

#### Phase 2: Execution (Subagents)

**What You Send to Subagents**:

In a single message, you spin up subagents to perform design tasks in parallel, **one subagent per page** requested.

- **[IMPORTANT]** Each subagent is responsible for creating ONE complete design page with all 15 ASCII designs
- **[IMPORTANT]** When there are any issues reported, you must stop dispatching further subagents until all issues have been rectified
- **[IMPORTANT]** You MUST ask all subagents to ultrathink hard about the task and requirements
- **[IMPORTANT]** Use TodoWrite to update each page's status from 'pending' to 'in_progress' when dispatched

Request each subagent to perform the following steps with full detail:
