description: Create or maintain the versioned asset and render manifest for a production work stream — register source assets with content hashes and rights, record every render with its exact inputs and settings, and mark stale entries when a decision invalidates them. Use when footage, audio, graphics, fonts, or a new render/export needs durable identity; this skill writes manifests, never media bytes.

# Track Assets

Maintain a text manifest that gives every media asset and render a stable
identity, exact provenance, and rights status, so "reproduce render v12" is an
operation and an approval can bind to one exact revision. Media bytes stay
outside Git; their identity and lineage do not.

## Boundaries

- Use for registering assets, recording renders/exports, updating rights or
  delivery state, and marking validity after an invalidating decision.
- Do not edit, move, or delete media files; do not perform review or approval
  (`production:review-render`), and do not manage work-stream state
  (Essential owns the lifecycle).
- Never invent a hash, duration, or rights fact — record only observed values
  and mark the rest as pending verification.

## Engineering-work gate

Before creating or materially rewriting a project artifact, read the absolute
`engineering-work.md` path injected by Essential; if unavailable, stop
artifact writes and report the missing contract. Then read Essential's
`templates/asset-manifest.md` (the manifest shape) and
`references/anchors.md` (anchor declarations). The manifest is a durable
versioned document: default location `docs/production/<deliverable-slug>/assets.md`
unless the work stream's charter names another; work-local exploration stays
under the stream's `.engineering/` per the contract.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the manifest: the given path, the charter's declared manifest, or
   propose the default location for user confirmation. Read it fully when it
   exists; never regenerate it from scratch over an existing file.
2. For each asset to register or update: record the stable id (never renamed
   or reused), kind, store locator, content hash (`sha256sum` when the bytes
   are reachable; otherwise `pending`), observed technical facts, provenance
   inputs by id and revision for derived assets, and rights (owner, consent,
   licence, expiry). Ask the user rather than guessing a rights fact.
3. For each render: add a **new entry per revision** — an entry is history and
   is never edited into its successor. Record the timeline/project revision,
   the hash of the assets section it was built from, render settings (preset,
   fonts, LUTs, plugins, templates), output hash, and delivery destination.
4. When a decision invalidates an asset or render, append
   `validity: stale (<decision-id>)` to that entry and leave it in place;
   record which entries the decision `preserves` untouched. Never delete an
   entry that any render or approval references.
5. Return the manifest path and a summary of entries added, updated, and
   marked stale in `generated_files`; report hashes still `pending` so the
   next session can complete them.

## Verification

- Every derived asset and every render names the exact inputs (id + revision
  or hash) it was built from; no entry was renamed, reused, or deleted.
- Rights fields are observed or user-confirmed, never invented; expiries and
  consent refs are present or explicitly null.
- Stale entries kept their history and name the invalidating decision.

## Completion

Report the manifest path, entry counts by disposition (added / updated /
stale-marked / pending-hash), and `generated_files`.
