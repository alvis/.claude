# Execution mechanisms

The parent selects deterministic scripted execution for independent code-producing slices and a sequential Coding chain otherwise. The orchestrator does not edit source or history.

## Shared dispatch contract

Each child receives absolute repository/work paths, exact specification refs and headings, one full executable `task_id`, canonical `plan_source`, acceptance criteria, deviation policy, and the Essential output-manifest rule. Coding agents treat work-spec transport bodies as read-only. Architectural uncertainty returns `pending_decision`; only the orchestrator may ask and route the answer through the selected source owner. For a Notion-backed path, use only the exact `body_author` explicitly bound by the parent. Every code-producing child receives `--defer-publication` and the explicit `review_ownership` capsule from `coding:directions/review-evidence.md`. It may create a slice-local commit through `coding:commit`, but must not pass `--create-pr`, run `coding:pr create`, restack, or otherwise publish before the parent review/sync gate.

## Parallel-execution mechanism

1. Read root `state.md` (and any `state/*.md` children) directly and determine `runnable_leaf_task_ids` from the task table. Parent tasks are roll-ups. All parent predecessors and sibling dependencies must be done; table order is never scheduling authority.
2. Fan out ready leaves whose write scopes do not conflict. Each runs its mode-appropriate Coding writer with deferred publication, self-checks, focused validation, and evidence/risk handback, then local-only `coding:commit` on success.
3. Check each landed task's requirement/criterion against its exact implementation and focused validation evidence. Return missing or failing evidence to the child. Independent scrutiny belongs to the named delivery owner's integrated review; add leaf verification only for a specific risk-required check or an explicit child review boundary, recording its reason and scope.
4. Reconcile child results by exact task ID, never completion order. Require the unchanged task definitions, `pass|fail|partial` attempt outcome, evidence, generated files, and requested status delta. Requeue a refuted task with evidence. For a failed leaf, the main agent marks every downstream executable leaf `! blocked` with an `unblock:` action tied to that failure's retry/disposition; independent branches retain their current/runnable state. Re-read root state directly before each dispatch wave. Stop on a decision or iteration/token guard; never silently downgrade or continue stale work.

```yaml
plan_source: state.md
verified_task_ids: []
pending_decisions:
  - {task_id: '', spec_loc: '', question: '', options: [], rationale: ''}
local_commits: [{sha: '', message: '', published: false}]
child_dispatch_log: [{task_id: '', skill: '', attempt: pass|fail|partial, requested_status: planned|working|done|failed|blocked|cancelled, evidence: [], summary: ''}]
invalidated_downstream_closure: []
generated_files: []
departures: []
unresolved: []
```

On a pending decision, record the answer through the selected source owner (the bound `body_author` for a Notion-backed path), update the work receipt hash, and resume the same run so completed tasks remain cached when both the specification and task definitions are unchanged.

The named delivery owner performs one integrated alignment/general/security review; inner parents forward that owner and their evidence. It retains usage trace, Notion completion/revalidation loop, and only then final history/publication.

## Sequential mechanism

Run the selected chain from `modes.md` in the live session. Apply the same decision stop, deferred-publication rule, deviation reporting, parent-owned independent-review boundary, and manifest collection. Do not write main-agent-owned overview/state files or invoke a publication path.
