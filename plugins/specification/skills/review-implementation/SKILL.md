# Review Implementation

Review specification alignment and Coding concerns in one independent holistic session without duplicating their detection protocols. Accept the integrated review assignment from the single delivery owner under `coding:directions/review-evidence.md`. The reviewer returns canonical area reports; the main agent owns preparation, specialist handbacks, work-local persistence, and the disposition summary.

## Boundaries

- Require a verified authoritative specification and its work-local provenance. Local and inline-origin specifications resolve through their receipt; invoke `sync-spec` at every freshness gate for a selected Notion source. Identify Notion sources by receipt/frontmatter ref, not filename. A reachable `repo:` source remains authoritative even when the caller passes its work-local copy.
- `alignment.md` owns contract conformance. `correctness.md` owns semantic bugs that are wrong independently of the specification. The other areas are `security.md`, `quality.md`, `testing.md`, `docs.md`, and `style.md`.
- Do not create `audit.md`, `deviations.md`, review `readme.md`, root review files, or duplicate a finding across areas. Contract/completeness audit gaps route to alignment; plan departures stay in work state/changes.
- Review remains read-only with respect to implementation and MDC.
- One independent holistic reviewer returns complete proposed `reviews/<area>.md` content and its deltas without writing `.state`. It executes both this skill and `coding:review-code` directly, never dispatching another reviewer. The main agent writes the areas, reconciles `review.md`, and persists the companion input-binding receipt for publication reuse.

## Inputs and outputs

Follow the injected `essential:references/state.md` resolver contract and use only its resolved active work. On `work_id_required` or `requires_ignore`, follow its main-agent/worker disposition exactly. Resolve area output under the active work's `reviews/`; `--area=all` is default. Alignment-only still requires current correctness and security coverage through `coding:review-code`; verified input-bound evidence may satisfy it without rerunning unchanged analysis. For a Notion source that may require materialization, a direct main-agent run accepts the exact transport root plus explicit absolute `--transport-profile` file, or resolves one destination-local file from an active-state mapping containing logical name and last verified exact-byte SHA-256. A delegated run instead receives the main agent's exact `sync-spec materialize` result and its matching goal/receipt anchors; it never invokes transport or refreshes state. Never infer a profile location from its name/root. Root `state.md` is authoritative and must report `plan_source: state.md` with its task definitions and graph. Optional values passed by a lifecycle parent are assertions that must match it, not overrides. An explicit detail link may be followed for ID-keyed implementation procedure, never for task definitions.

## Workflow

1. Use the resolved work/review roots and read only the state/spec pointers needed for alignment. Before any project artifact write, apply the injected `essential:references/state.md` artifact-write gate. Read root `state.md` (and any `state/*.md` children) directly; from the task table, determine which tasks are runnable, which are blocked, the current owner, and the next action, and proceed on that reading — there is no separate validation step. Confirm `plan_source: state.md` and retain its canonical `plan_source`, task definitions, and task graphs. Reject an invalid graph or any caller-supplied plan identity that differs from the read state. Follow only root state's explicit implementation-detail link and reject any duplicate/contradictory task IDs, edges, requiredness, targets, or acceptance mappings there. Never guess between directory children or a root planning file.
2. Resolve the selected source, work-local specification, and provenance before review. For a reachable `repo:` local source, compare the source and work-local copy directly against provenance, require both to match the approved specification content, and use the content-derived Git blob oid as optional revision evidence. Missing/moved source, source drift, stale provenance, or work-local drift returns `ready_for_specification`; never review whichever copy happened to be passed. For `local-approved:` or `inline-approved:` provenance, compare the sole active-work specification without requiring the ignored origin. Before any review dispatch, the main-agent caller invokes `Skill(sync-spec)` in `materialize` mode for every Notion URL/id with the selected transport root and explicit `--transport-profile=<absolute-file>`, even when `goal.md`, the local copy, and its receipt already match. In a direct main-agent run, perform that probe now. A delegated run never invokes `sync-spec`: verify the caller-supplied materialization result and matching goal/receipt anchors read-only. If that evidence is absent, mismatched, or not from this review gate, return `needs_revalidation` with a bounded main-agent refresh request and no partial review reports. This external probe is the mandatory pre-review freshness gate. Continue only on `status: success` with `next_action: none`. A previously matching receipt does not waive the probe: if the fresh pull returns `remote_only` or `structural_change` with `next_action: revalidate`, return `needs_revalidation` before dispatch.
   <external-review-freshness source="external" action="sync-spec:materialize" owner="main-agent" when="always" delegated="request-main-agent-refresh" remote-change="needs_revalidation" />
   Refuse without partial reports when no authoritative specification can be resolved. Bind the review to the exact approved specification content; pass that content reference to every reviewer, along with the canonical plan source and task definitions and applicable full task IDs. Never combine incompatible findings; carry forward an unaffected report only after verifying its governing bindings against the current contract through `coding:directions/review-evidence.md`.
   After this gate, the main-agent caller prepares resolved coverage (alignment plus requested areas, always including correctness and security), temporary area paths, mechanical evidence, and risk-specific staffing through `coding:review-code`'s dispatch contract. It retains the original independent holistic reviewer for follow-ups, or assigns one fresh critic without inherited implementation context when none is available. Classify changed inputs and retain valid coverage through `coding:directions/review-evidence.md` before assigning missing or affected analysis. An already assigned independent reviewer continues directly; it returns missing preparation or specialist needs to the main agent instead of dispatching. The main agent retains Steps 6–8's user interaction, canonical persistence, and final external freshness probes.
3. Resolve implementation scope with `coding:review-code` semantics. On follow-ups, trace the affected requirements, implementation dependencies, and prior findings; retain verified unaffected alignment evidence. Enumerate requirements, invariants, schemas, acceptance criteria, and non-functional posture; when the charter `goal.md` defines `SC-n` success criteria, include each as an alignment obligation and cite the covered `SC-n` IDs in findings and dispositions, so closure is checkable per criterion — every required criterion needs an `applied` change and a closed disposition covering it. Trace spec-to-code for omission/drift and code-to-spec for unsanctioned behavior; search the repository before declaring absence.
4. Adversarially refute each candidate and retain only survivors. Every alignment finding cites both spec and implementation locations and uses stable `ALIGN-P<n>-<seq>` identity across reruns.
5. Load every existing canonical area artifact into the reconciliation view, preserving its latest evidence and verdict even when that area is not selected on this run. In the same independent reviewer session, invoke `Skill(coding:review-code)` directly for requested non-alignment areas, for missing or affected correctness/security coverage as well as other requested areas. Current valid correctness and security evidence remains mandatory; unchanged analysis is reused. Use the prepared coverage, mechanical and specialist evidence, work id, canonical plan identity, applicable full task IDs, and assigned temporary area paths; do not redispatch. Spec conformance belongs only in `alignment.md`. Incorporate required specialist handbacks and return all proposed area reports and counts/deltas for main-agent reconciliation.
6. The main agent reconciles alignment findings with the user: update spec, update code, acknowledge/waive, defer, or skip with required closure metadata. A delegated reviewer returns decision needs without prompting. Apply the lifecycle in [references/deviation-lifecycle.md](references/deviation-lifecycle.md). A decision does not clear a gap until its action lands, except valid acknowledgement/skip risk acceptance. P0/P1 risk acceptance requires explicit authority and durable evidence.
7. Return coherent proposed `alignment.md` content. The main agent writes it, then aggregates preserved existing area results with current-run deltas. Return each executed area's canonical `pass|pass_with_suggestions|requires_changes|fail` verdict, count, finding-disposition (`open`, `fixed`, `acknowledged`, `deferred`, `skipped`) deltas, and next-action pointers to the main agent. Use `not_run` only when an area has no existing or current execution evidence; it is not a finding disposition. A delegated reviewer never writes `review.md`.
8. Immediately before finalization, the main-agent caller re-runs the complete Step 2 source/work-local-specification authority, external freshness probe, and direct content comparison, plus the Essential state re-read from Step 1. A delegated run re-reads only the supplied local evidence, returns proposed reports, and tells the main agent that this final probe remains required; it never invokes transport or writes a protected state system. Source/provenance/work-local-specification drift returns `ready_for_specification`; changed specification content or task definitions return `needs_revalidation`. In either case discard the stale roll-up and do not emit a clean verdict. Only a sync-spec `classification: metadata_only` that passed its unit-by-unit restriction may update paired revision evidence without invalidating findings; `structural_change` invalidates them even when the content is otherwise unchanged. Re-read `state.md` and the task table directly, fix once, and re-read to confirm. Return explicit final paths generated or materially rewritten as `generated_files`. Each writer follows `essential:references/output-manifest.md` for work Markdown it creates or rewrites.

## Verification

- All seven canonical areas appear in the reconciliation payload. An area with no existing or current execution evidence is `not_run`; it is never encoded as skipped/refused. Correctness and security have verified current input-bound evidence, from baseline review plus any affected-scope rechecks, and therefore can never be `not_run` on a completed review.
- Alignment and Coding coverage ran in one independent holistic session; required specialist evidence was incorporated without nested review dispatch. The main agent retained mechanical preparation, transport probes, and canonical persistence.
- Findings are single-owned, source-cited, adversarially checked, and their dispositions/counts agree between detail and summary.
- Stable IDs and prior reconciliation survive reruns; only closed gaps clear.
- A clean disposition is bound to the exact approved specification content; confirm by direct comparison. Specification content changes invalidate it even when implementation bytes are unchanged.
- A clean disposition is also bound to the reviewed task definitions. Status, owner, and evidence updates retain it; task-definition changes require re-review.
- Every approval carries the full binding tuple from Essential's `approvals.md`: artifact id, its content hash or immutable revision, reviewer (`capability_id` or user) and authority, approved scope, and unresolved exceptions. `needs_revalidation` marks affected done work `validity: stale` per the state contract; it never flips a `✓ done` row. Approvals are journaled state changes under the same append-first discipline as every other state change.
- `generated_files` lists only artifacts the main agent actually wrote; a delegated review payload carries proposed area content and roll-up deltas.

## Alignment contract

For each requirement record requirement, spec location, implementation location, `satisfied|missing|drift|unsanctioned`, severity, evidence, disposition, and next action. A broken acceptance criterion/weakened invariant is P0; contract drift is P0/P1 by blast radius; documentation-only divergence is P2/P3. Keep independently wrong behavior in `correctness.md`.
