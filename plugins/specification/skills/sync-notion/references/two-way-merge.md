# Base-aware two-way merge

Load only for `two-way-merge`. Although the public mode has a familiar name,
the safety decision is a three-way comparison of immutable base B, current
local L, and a fresh remote staging pull R.

## Preconditions

For every pair require stable identity, B bytes/hash from an immutable receipt,
L bytes/hash, R bytes/hash/revision, and a caller-declared staging/evidence
root. Missing base evidence returns `status: refused`,
`classification: baseline_required`, and `next_action: establish_baseline`;
never manufacture a base from L or a cached mirror.

When called by `sync-spec`, compare the specification content directly: exact
bytes and revision protect transport, and semantic content equality
(disregarding the volatile `last_edited_time` line) drives the relationships
below. Never approve content you have not compared directly against B.

Classify before conflict work:

- `L == B && R == B`: unchanged; no write or push.
- `L != B && R == B`: local-only; no merge needed, but outbound approval and
  the pre-push revision gate still apply.
- `L == B && R != B`: remote-only; stage a pull candidate and return
  operational `status: success`, `classification: remote_only`, and
  `next_action: revalidate` to a specification caller rather than overwriting
  local work or pushing it back.
- `L != B && R != B && L == R`: converged; verify and establish a new base,
  with no push.
- `L != B && R != B && L != R`: concurrent; follow the protocol below.

## Phase 1 — conflict packets

Fan out read-only comparison workers by independent pair. Workers never invoke
`AskUserQuestion`, choose a winner, edit canonical local/mirror files, or push.
Each worker:

1. Computes deterministic section/block differences from B→L and B→R. It may
   use structured diff output supported by the pinned CLI, but must not invent a
   flag; deterministic comparison of staged bytes is the fallback.
2. Maps transport block ids to the nearest stable heading/path for presentation
   while retaining ids only as write-back evidence.
3. Distinguishes non-overlapping changes from overlapping conflicts. It builds
   candidate Keep Local, Keep Remote, and coherent Keep Both content without
   applying any candidate.
4. Stores a bounded conflict packet and candidate content under the declared
   staging/evidence root, and returns paths rather than embedding a complete
   document in the task response.

```yaml
pair:
  local_path: ''
  notion_ref: ''
  base: {revision: ''}
  local: {revision: ''}
  remote: {revision: ''}
packet_path: ''
conflicts:
  - id: ''
    section: ''
    kind: addition|removal|modification
    evidence: {base: '', local: '', remote: ''}
    candidates: {keep_local: {path: ''}, keep_remote: {path: ''}, keep_both: {path: ''}}
issues: []
```

A worker failure aborts that pair without canonical writes.

## Phase 2 — owner decisions

The coordinator loads each packet and asks the PM/user for every material
conflict. Present bounded B/L/R evidence and these choices:

- **Keep Local** — use the local section.
- **Keep Remote** — use the fresh remote section.
- **Keep Both** — use the coherent synthesis, after showing it and receiving
  explicit approval of its candidate content.
- **Skip** — leave the pair untouched for later resolution.

Keep Both must integrate facts into the owning section without parallel
“local”/“Notion” sections or provenance banners. Any revision to the synthesis
changes its content and requires approval again. Skip never inserts a TODO or
feeds a push candidate.

## Phase 3 — freeze and apply

Assemble one complete final proposal for the pair in staging, preserve
frontmatter/order/identity. Require the caller's stage-specific approval/review
to be bound to the final specification content, confirmed by direct comparison.
If any conflict is skipped, unresolved,
or failed, mark the pair `partial` and apply nothing to its canonical local,
mirror, or remote sides.

When the caller declares `stage=implementation`, return operational
`status: success`, `classification: concurrent`, and
`next_action: specification_reconciliation` with the immutable proposal and
apply nothing. The owning specification flow must approve and publish it through
specification stage, verify it, establish/materialize a new base, and invalidate
plan/code/review before implementation can resume. Never push proposal M from
this implementation-stage merge.

For a fully resolved `.mdc` pair, the coordinator applies the staged body only
through `Skill(mdc)` after all decisions and approval gates pass. Plain Markdown may
be atomically promoted only when the caller permits it. Do not push here; the
mode execution branch owns the immediate remote recheck, guarded push, and
verification pull.

```yaml
status: success|partial|failure|refused
classification: resolved|unchanged|local_only|remote_only|converged|concurrent|baseline_required
next_action: none|revalidate|establish_baseline|resolve_conflict|specification_reconciliation|provide_conditional_transport
pair: {local_path: '', notion_ref: ''}
conflicts: {found: 0, resolved: 0, skipped: 0}
decisions: {keep_local: 0, keep_remote: 0, keep_both: 0}
final_proposal: {path: '', revision: '', approved: false}
canonical_writes: 0
push_allowed: false
```

Operational execution and relationship classification are separate. A missing
base is `status: refused`, `classification: baseline_required`, and
`next_action: establish_baseline`; remote-only is successful read-only
classification plus `revalidate`; an implementation-stage concurrent proposal
is successful read-only classification plus `specification_reconciliation`.
Never encode those relationship outcomes as new top-level status values.
