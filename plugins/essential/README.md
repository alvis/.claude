# Essential

The backbone every other plugin depends on. Essential owns the cross-plugin **state lifecycle**: how work gets a durable identity, how its state survives crashes and machine moves, how decisions and approvals stay honest as reality changes, and how work retires without losing anything consequential. It also carries the research/decision skills and the agent installer.

## The contracts

Contracts load progressively: Claude Code and Codex inject the small `hooks/ALLAGENT.md`, `hooks/MAINAGENT.md`, and `hooks/SUBAGENT.md` entry points; everything else is read at the moment it matters. Once per session, `hooks/STOP.md` blocks with a `.state` reminder. Grok ignores context-injection and Stop stdout, so the reminder is advisory there.

| `./directions/change-control.md` | On a mid-execution finding | Task-local / plan-level / spec-level routing |
| `./directions/retirement.md` | When promoting, parking, or retiring | Promotion provenance, idle-stream parking, retirement gates |
| `./directions/subagent.md` | At the start of an assigned subagent task | The whole worker contract: stable reference, report shape and ceiling, read-only state and resolver gate, escalation, ineligibility transfer |
| `references/output-manifest.md` | When returning a `generated_files` manifest, or writing Markdown into `.state/` | Manifest shape, the 16,384-byte work-Markdown rule the writer observes, the general length rule |
| `./directions/delegate.md` | Before dispatching a subagent or composing a first task handover | Specialist routing, required prompt fields, extensible Context, message ceiling, teammate naming, nesting, intelligence resolution |

Templates: `templates/memory.md` (agent memory), `templates/docs/*.template.md` (shared durable directory entrypoints), and `./templates/initiative.md` (Essential's initiative-domain semantic authority). Domain plugins own their own semantic templates.

## The tools

- **`scripts/resolve-state-workspace`** — resolves the work identity and paths, enforces the `.state/` ignore gate and symlink/traversal safety, and performs the main-agent-only no-clobber bootstrap of `goal.md`, `state.md`, `state/working.md`, and `state/journal.md`.
- **`scripts/state-lease`** — the on-disk main-agent lease (`ensure | acquire | heartbeat | release | status | takeover`). The file stores only the token's SHA-256 digest, so reading it never confers the lease; exactly one live token may write main-agent-owned state; a live foreign lease is never replaced; an expired foreign lease yields only to an explicit, journaled takeover.
- **`scripts/state-write`** — the lease-verified write path: verifies the presented token, refuses free/expired/foreign leases, heartbeats, and applies the temp-write + atomic rename in one call, so a working main agent can never expire its own lease by working.
- **`skills/doctor/scripts/state-doctor`** — read-only structural checker: duplicate or malformed task IDs, dangling dependencies, cycles, impossible roll-ups, contradictory mark/status pairs, missing evidence annotations, broken file references, unsuperseded decisions, ADR archive/index/integrity drift, stale leases, overview drift. Advisory by default; `--strict` for irreversible or release-critical moments. It never silently edits files.

## Skills

| Skill | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| `essential:discover` | Finding material unknowns before planning: blindspot passes, brainstorms, interviews, reference extraction, disposable prototypes. |
| `essential:decide` | Choosing between researched approaches; records the approved decision with causal metadata and hands off to the owner. |
| `essential:deep-research` | Multi-source fact-finding with adversarial claim verification and citations. |
| `essential:autoresearch` | Metric-driven optimization loops (define metric → evolve candidates → verify → mutate). |
| `essential:handover` | Pausing work: persists all stream state, updates the global overview, releases leases. |
| `essential:takeover` | Resuming paused work from the on-disk work directories: checks leases, resolves blocking decisions, and drives streams to their success criteria. |
| `essential:doctor` | Health-checking `.state/`: runs the structural doctor, diagnoses format drift against the current contracts, and offers user-approved migration to the latest structure — judged by reading the contracts, never a version token. |
| `essential:handoff` | A zero-context cross-domain orchestration plan another agent can execute verbatim. |
| `essential:install` | Installing or refreshing native specialist agents and Grok's startup attachment. |
| `essential:uninstall` | Removing owned agents and the Grok attachment while preserving edited or unrelated files. |
| `essential:install-output-styles` | Installing bundled Claude Code output styles into `~/.claude/output-styles/`. |
| `essential:install-statusline` | Installing the bundled Bullet Train statusline. |

## How state stays trustworthy

- **Append first, reconcile second.** Every transition lands in `state/journal.md` (with actor `capability_id`, `rev:<N>`, event type, and what it invalidates) before tables update; crash loss is bounded to one line.
- **One writer.** The lease holder alone writes `goal.md`, `state.md`, `state/*.md`, overviews, and `review.md`; workers return deltas.
- **Done stays done.** Invalidation marks `validity: stale` and spawns remediation tasks; history is never falsified.
- **`.state/` becomes disposable only after durable promotion and closure.** It is not byte-reconstructible. Decisions, approvals, artifact identities, unresolved risks, and reusable conclusions need durable carriers first; keep a copy of active work to guard against `git clean -fdx`.
