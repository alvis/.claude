# Making plans

Read this direction before creating, revising, or presenting any plan. A plan
may be a short conversational sequence, a persisted handoff, a task graph, or a
commit/PR structure. Domain directions may add detail; they do not replace the
minimum contract below.

<IMPORTANT>
A plan is a route through authoritative truth, not another home for that truth.
Read the current contract, decisions, execution state, and evidence first. Link
to their owning files instead of copying details that can drift. If a required
source is absent or contradictory, name the gap and route it to its owner; do
not invent a coherent-looking plan around it.
</IMPORTANT>

## Scale the plan to risk

Use the lightest process that still protects the outcome. Low-risk, reversible,
well-bounded work can proceed after a concise goal, scope, and assumption check,
followed by proportionate validation. Add the material-work details below when a
wrong choice would waste substantial work, the blast radius is unclear, the
change is difficult to reverse, or the outcome carries consequential product,
security, data, financial, operational, or user-visible risk.

Validation depth follows the risk and claims; ceremony cannot substitute for
evidence. [ALLAGENT.md](../hooks/ALLAGENT.md) owns mandatory gates and changed-premise handling.

## Required ingredients

Every presented plan, including conversational and sample plans, uses the five
headings below in order. Keep small plans concise; do not create a plan artifact
for formatting alone. When another artifact owns an ingredient, give its exact
path and only the summary needed to navigate it. Progress checklists are not plan
presentations.

### Goal

State one verifiable outcome and the bar that proves it was achieved. Link the
authoritative charter or specification when one exists.

### Requirements

List observable conditions the outcome must satisfy. Preserve identifiers from
the authoritative contract so execution and verification can cite them.

### Boundary

Name what is inside the plan, what is deliberately outside it, and any limit on
authority, time, systems, data, or validation that changes execution. Name the
accepted assumptions specifically enough to falsify them, and separate unknowns
from defaults.

### Direction

State the chosen route: ordered work or dependency graph, owners where relevant,
verification at each meaningful boundary, and stop or pivot signals. Link
material choices to their decision records; do not reopen accepted decisions in
the plan.

### Context

Include exactly these navigation aids:

- **Current state** — a brief, revision-aware status and the immediate next
  action or blocker.
- **Related decisions** — zero or more record items, one per directly related
  decision. Each summary uses at most 19 words, excludes decision detail, and
  links the file containing the full decision.
- **Related recent work** — zero or more record items, one per directly related
  work record. Each summary uses at most 19 words, excludes decisions, and
  links the file containing the full journey.

Exclude records that are merely adjacent to the plan.

Under each related-record label, use `None — no directly related record` only
after checking the applicable authority; never create a placeholder file to
satisfy a context line.

## Material-work additions

Where the risk warrants it, add only these details to the ingredients above.
Adapt them to the domain and omit categories the work does not touch; role and
workflow contracts determine who accepts the plan and when execution may begin.

<report>

- Under Boundary, number every falsifiable assumption and cover only relevant
  failure modes, dependencies, permissions, non-goals, and validation limits.
- Under Direction, name the evidence that validates each material step and the
  rejected alternative for each material choice, with its reason in one clause.
- After Context, list only blocking questions whose wrong answer would throw
  work away, with a recommended default; write `0 — none` when there are none.

</report>

## Truth ownership in work state

For a lifecycle-managed work stream, the shared ingredients are distributed
without duplication:

- `goal.md` supplies Goal, Requirements, and Boundary through the charter link;
- root `../references/state.md` task definitions and dependency edges supply Direction; and
- root status plus links to `decisions/` and `state/journal.md` supply Context.

Non-authoritative detail such as `state/plan.md` may expand an existing task ID,
but it cannot redefine any shared ingredient. Follow the state lifecycle for
ownership, revisions, and approval.

## Revision and verification

Revise Direction without operator approval when evidence changes the route but
Goal, Requirements, and Boundary remain fixed and the owning workflow grants
that authority. Surface any proposed contract change to its owner before
continuing.

Before handing off, approving, or executing a plan, check that all five sections
are present, the goal is verifiable, scope and assumptions are clear, and the
next step and validation are executable. Verify that context is current, links
resolve, records are directly related, and each record summary is at most 19
words. Hook feedback requires rereading this direction and presenting the
corrected plan; an acknowledgement does not resolve rejected plan content.
