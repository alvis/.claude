"""Run the Discover presentation validator as part of the repository suite.

The validator is a CLI module named ``test_html_templates.py`` that pytest
cannot collect (it holds no test functions and shadows the naming convention),
so ``pytest.ini`` ignores it and this wrapper imports it by path instead. Until
this file existed, the repository's own rule — every mechanical gate is a pytest
test — was false for the largest generator in the tree.

``run("complete")`` compiles boards through ``build_artifact.build``, which
downloads the Tailwind and Mermaid runtimes unless the gitignored vendor cache
holds them. CI has a network, so the gate runs there. An offline developer gets
a skip rather than a failure that says nothing about their change.
