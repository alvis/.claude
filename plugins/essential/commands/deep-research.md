# Deep Research Command

Conduct systematic, multi-source research on $ARGUMENTS using AI-powered analysis and cross-referenced insights.

## üéØ Purpose & Scope

**What this command does NOT do**:

- Generate research without source attribution
- Create content without verification

**When to REJECT**:

- Topic is better suited for simple web search

## üîÑ Workflow

ultrathink: you'd perform the following steps

### Step 1: Planning

1. **Analyze Requirements**
   - Parse research topic from $ARGUMENTS
   - Identify optional focus areas
   - Determine research scope and boundaries
   - **Select Research Strategy** based on topic type:
     - **Technical/Scientific**: Prioritize academic papers, documentation, code repos
     - **Historical**: Focus on primary sources, archives, temporal progression
     - **Current Events**: Emphasize recent sources, news, real-time updates
     - **Theoretical/Conceptual**: Balance foundational texts with recent developments
     - **Product/Market**: Industry reports, user feedback, competitive analysis
   - Plan source discovery strategy aligned with selected approach

2. **Initialize Research Infrastructure**
   - Create research workspace: `research_$ARGUMENTS_$(date +%Y%m%d)`
   - Initialize source tracker: `source_tracker.md`
   - Set up finding templates for cross-source insights
   - **Check for existing research sessions**: Look for `source_tracker.md` in workspace
     - If exists: Resume from last state (check status fields)
     - Auto-save progress to tracker after each source analysis
     - Tracker serves as both documentation and checkpoint
     - Resume capability: Continue from any 'pending' or 'analyzing' sources

   **Source Tracker Format**:

   ```markdown
   # Research Source Tracker: $ARGUMENTS
   
   ## Session Metadata
   - Started: [timestamp]
   - Last Updated: [timestamp]
   - Current Level: [1-3]
   - Session Status: active | paused | completed
   
   ## Source: [filename/URL]
   - Status: pending | analyzing | analyzed | duplicate-of:[source]
   - Discovery: initial | discovered-from:[parent-source]
   - **Credibility**: Academic | Official | Industry | Community | Unverified
   - **Recency**: [publication/update date if available]
   - Summary: [2 sentences max when analyzed]
   - Key Findings:
     1. [Finding with relevance to topic]
     2. [Additional findings...]
   - Relevance: High | Medium | Low | None
   - **Discovered Sources**:
     - [new-source-1]: [reason for discovery]
     - [new-source-2]: [insight that triggered discovery]
   - **Follow-up Required**:
     - [concept needing deeper research]
     - [reference requiring investigation]
   ```

3. **Identify Applicable Workflows & Standards**
   - Identify any relevant workflows for research processes or write one if there is none
   - Identify any related documentation standards or write one if there is none
   - Note: MUST follow any matching workflows and standards if there are any

4. **Delegation Decision**
   - Plan parallel source analysis tasks
   - Identify specialized research agents needed
   - Define synthesis coordination points

5. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify potential source reliability issues
   - Plan verification strategies
   - Note information gaps

### Step 2: Execution

1. **Workflow Compliance**
   - MUST follow workflows identified in Phase 1
   - Apply research methodology standards
   - Reference specific workflow files when applicable

2. **Primary Implementation**
   - Dispatch subagents for iterative source analysis
   - Each agent analyzes assigned sources for:
     - Key information relevant to topic
     - Cross-source patterns and themes
     - Contradictions and debates
     - **NEW INSIGHTS requiring further research**
   - Update source tracker with analysis status
   - **CRITICAL: When finding new insights, discover additional sources**

   **Dispatch Format for Subagents**:

   ```text
   Task: Analyze [source] for insights related to "$ARGUMENTS"
   
   1. Update source_tracker.md status to 'analyzing'
   2. Extract key information relevant to research topic
   3. **IMPORTANT: For each new finding/insight**:
      - Identify potential follow-up sources
      - Add new sources to tracker with status 'pending'
      - Deep research related concepts/references mentioned
      - Document source chain: original ‚Üí discovered
   4. Create/update cross-source finding files for patterns
   5. Report completion with summary, findings, and newly discovered sources
   ```

3. **Cross-Source Finding Format**
   - Pattern/Theme identification
   - Evidence compilation from multiple sources
   - Implication analysis for research topic
   - Source attribution with locations

   **Cross-Source Finding Format**:

   ```markdown
   # Finding: [Pattern/Theme Name]
   
   ## Summary
   [1-2 sentence overview of the finding]
   
   ## Evidence from Sources
   - **[source1]**: "[Direct quote/reference]" (page/section)
   - **[source2]**: "[Supporting evidence]" (location)
   
   ## Implications
   [Analysis of what this means for the research topic]
   
   ## Triggers New Research
   - [New concept discovered requiring investigation]
   - [Reference to unexplored area]
   - [Connection to related field]
   ```

4. **Iterative Deep Research Strategy**
   - **Discovery Triggers**: When subagents identify:
     - Unfamiliar concepts or terminology
     - References to related work
     - Gaps in understanding
     - Contradictory information requiring more context
   - **Action Protocol**:
     1. Add discovered sources to tracker immediately
     2. Spawn new research tasks for high-relevance discoveries
     3. Update finding files with connection chains
     4. Document research depth (initial ‚Üí level 2 ‚Üí level 3)
   - **Depth Limits**: Maximum 3 levels of iterative discovery
   - **Priority Management**: High-relevance discoveries analyzed first

5. **Edge Case Handling**
   - No sources found: Expand search parameters
   - **Duplicate sources**: Check content similarity before analysis
     - If duplicate: Mark as `duplicate-of:[original]` and skip
     - If variant: Analyze for additional insights only
   - Conflicting information: Document all perspectives
   - Subagent timeout: Mark as failed, continue with available data
   - Discovery overflow: Prioritize by relevance + credibility
   - Circular references: Document but don't re-analyze
   - **Early termination**: If high-confidence convergent evidence achieved

### Step 3: Verification

1. **Quality Assurance**
   - Verify all sources marked as analyzed have summaries
   - **Confirm discovered sources are tracked and processed**
   - Cross-reference findings across multiple sources
   - Identify contradictions between sources
   - Flag gaps in research coverage
   - **Validate discovery chains (source ‚Üí insight ‚Üí new source)**

2. **Consolidation Tasks**
   - Merge similar findings from different subagents
   - Resolve conflicting information with source priority
   - **Apply Synthesis Framework**:
     - **Convergent Evidence**: Multiple sources supporting same conclusion
     - **Divergent Perspectives**: Document contrasting viewpoints with context
     - **Confidence Scoring**: Weight findings by source credibility + convergence
     - **Knowledge Gaps**: Explicitly mark where evidence is insufficient
   - Create synthesis notes for complex topics with confidence levels

3. **Source Validation**
   - Confirm source reliability and credibility
   - Check for citation accuracy
   - Verify quotes and references

4. **Side Effect Validation**
   - Clean temporary sketchpad files
   - Ensure all findings traceable to sources
   - Verify workspace organization

### Step 4: Reporting

**Output Format**:

```text
