# Work Handover

Refresh the work-stream memory under the **default source tree's** `.state/` — the resolver's `state_root`, the one tree that carries work state whichever worktree or workspace you are in — and update the global `.state/overview.md` beside it, so the session can stop here and a later one pick the work up exactly where it stands. `essential:takeover` owns resumption; it always resumes from the state files on disk.

## Boundaries

- Use for pausing work streams.
- Handover is scoped to the streams it is pausing. All state already lives in one place — `state_root/.state/works/` — so there is no other tree's state to reach into and no cross-tree merge to perform. Refresh the selected streams and upsert their `overview.md` rows; leave every other stream's files and rows byte-for-byte alone.
- Do not perform git history, push, PR, build, test, deployment, review, or implementation work.
- Write to exactly two destinations: `state_root/.state/works/<work-id>/**` and `state_root/.state/overview.md`. Handover does not promote to `docs/` — promotion belongs to completion, not to a pause — and it creates no continuation file of its own: the state files *are* the continuation.
- Never write a file because the report would be large. A long report is shortened to pointers into `.state/`, never spilled to disk; the persisted state on disk is already the durable outcome.
- Do not assume `.state/` is committed.
- Only the main agent may run this workflow because it writes `state/working.md` and reconciles work indexes and the overview.

## Inputs

- Optional `[work-id-filter]`; otherwise handle every work stream under `state_root/.state/works/`. A filter narrows the streams to refresh in full; it never invents a stream.
- Persistence requires only a repository checkout and a resolvable workspace. A pause needs nothing external.

## State gate

Before creating or materially rewriting a project artifact, read the absolute `state.md` path injected by Essential. If unavailable, stop artifact writes and report the missing contract. Run the resolver: its `state_root` is the default source tree that carries every work stream and the global `.state/overview.md`, whichever tree this session is working in. Resolve the work root, conventions, naming, and ownership from that reference before reading or writing state. Handover never mints an empty work item. Hold each selected stream's on-disk main-agent lease before rewriting its state in steps 5–7 with the idempotent `state-lease ensure` verb — it renews a lease this session already holds and acquires a free one; a live foreign lease (`contended`) stops that stream with a report. Perform the rewrites through the lease-verified write path in Essential's `lease.md`, bump `State revision` on each main-agent rewrite, and release every lease at completion.

Persistence always runs and always completes: it refreshes the current source tree's on-disk work state and the default tree's global `overview.md`. That is the whole outcome — a session can pause, close, and later resume from those files. Never terminate the run before the overview upsert.

## Workflow

1. List every `state_root/.state/works/<work-id>/` stream per the Essential contract — always the complete set, never narrowed by `[work-id-filter]`, because the overview upsert (step 7) must show every stream. For each stream, read `state.md` to record its phase, any separate `Blocked on:` value, and one-line headline. Partition the streams three ways: `planned` and `working` are **continuable**, whether runnable or currently blocked; `reviewing` is **awaiting landing** — its execution is finished and its applicable submission is recorded, so it is not continuable, but neither is it settled, and `essential:takeover` checks it for the applicable landing evidence; `completed` is an **index-only** row while it remains in `works/`. `archived` streams live outside `works/` and are not indexed here. None of these is an error. Then apply the optional `[work-id-filter]` to the continuable streams to derive the **selected** streams (all continuable streams when no filter is given); only the selected streams get a full refresh (steps 2–6). The filter never removes a stream from step 1 or the overview.
2. For each selected stream, use the root `state.md` read in step 1; read `state/working.md` only for missing navigation. Read its existing lazy overviews, `review.md`, and specification provenance in `goal.md`. Load linked detail, review-area, evidence, and specification bodies only to resolve changed state, reconciliation discrepancies, or unresolved evidence. Read every child's metadata needed to reconcile the selected stream's overviews in step 6; selective body reads never omit that inventory. From the `state.md` task table, determine which tasks are runnable, which are blocked, the current owner, and the next action; proceed on that reading, with no separate validation step. Treat repository and runtime evidence as authoritative over stale local memory. Any implementation detail that root state links is procedure keyed by existing task IDs, not plan authority.
3. For each selected stream, gather todos, current revision/bookmark/branch, working-copy status, staged and unstaged changes, untracked files, recent commits, and each specification's location: inline raw text, a repository-relative path, or a Notion reference with its captured revision. Reconcile that source into the seven fields in the stream's `goal.md` `## Specification provenance`: source kind, canonical specification, accepted revision/base, optional local materialization, matching receipt, last verification status, and last verification time. A bootstrap-only pending shape must be resolved before active execution. Classify changed and planned files with the substates in [./templates/documents.md](templates/documents.md).
4. For each selected stream, identify every material unresolved decision. Consult the user using [./directions/decision-consultation.md](directions/decision-consultation.md); route durable decision detail to `decisions/<slug>.md` and let the main agent reconcile `decisions.md`. Record low-impact reversible assumptions in `state.md` with evidence and recheck triggers.
5. Generate one UTC ISO-8601 timestamp for the whole run. For each selected stream, rewrite `state.md` as the complete work context: goal, full parent/subtask task table with marked status and evidence, phase, success criteria, decisions, dependencies, blockers, review dispositions, evidence, durable promotion, specification sync status linked to `goal.md`, and a prominent link to `state/working.md`. Include a `## Continuation` section persisting the current task ID, exact next owner, exact next action, a capability-level continuation intent describing the work type (never a fixed skill name), and the stream's **source anchor** — the revision the work assumes. State alone must be enough to route a resume and to tell a checkout which revision to be at. Follow [output-manifest.md](../../references/output-manifest.md) and split eligible work Markdown as it is written when required, keeping the original path as an overview.
6. For each selected stream, rewrite `state/working.md` to approximately 4,096 bytes through editorial discipline: current focus, current status, immediate handback point, and fast relative paths only. It is not a plan, history, or complete context. Do not mechanically size-gate it. Reconcile that stream's existing lazy `proposals.md`, `changes.md`, `decisions.md`, and `design.md` overview files from child metadata; never copy child details into an overview.
7. Update the global `state_root/.state/overview.md`, following the canonical shape in [./templates/documents.md](templates/documents.md). Immediately before writing, re-read the current `overview.md` so a concurrent update from another session is not lost. Reconcile `## State systems` as exactly three presence rows: version-controlled documentation and local operational state are `configured`; external specification authority is `none`, `configured`, or `pending`. This is a presence inventory only; canonical URL, revision, copy, receipt, and verification anchors remain in each stream's `goal.md`.

   Before removing a legacy global `Spec` cell, verify and persist its exact source in that stream's charter provenance. Then upsert one row per stream from step 1 — work ID, phase, blocker, headline, next action, `Location` (the checkout the stream is worked in: path plus kind and revision), and any `docs/` link in `Documentations` — excluding all specification links. Write the normalized overview once, atomically, and preserve every other row plus the authored `Goal` and `Requirements` sections byte-for-byte. If no `overview.md` exists yet, create it with the canonical `State systems` section. After this write, acknowledge each selected stream's current generation through `essential:directions/checkpoint.md` before releasing its lease. The pause is then complete and resumable from state files.
8. Return every created or materially rewritten path — including the updated `overview.md` — in `generated_files`.

## Verification

- Every selected stream's `state.md` (with its `## Continuation` fields) and `state/working.md` were refreshed and the global `overview.md` was upserted.
- Handover touched only `state_root/.state/works/` and `state_root/.state/overview.md`; no unselected stream's files were rewritten.
- `overview.md` now carries the canonical three-row `State systems` section and one up-to-date row per stream — each with its phase, blocker, `Location`, and documentation-only `Documentations` — and every row it did not own is unchanged.
- A takeover could resume every continuable stream from the on-disk state alone — `## Continuation` names the current task, next owner, next action, and continuation intent.
- No path outside the closed write set was created or rewritten: every entry in `generated_files` is under `state_root/.state/works/<work-id>/`, or is `state_root/.state/overview.md`. No continuation file was written anywhere else, and nothing was written because output was large.
- Each selected stream's `state.md` is complete, internally consistent, and links `state/working.md`; the latter contains only current-focus summary and fast paths.
- Every overview matches its children and canonical phase/task-status vocabularies.
- Decisions, assumptions, deviations, blockers, review dispositions, evidence, promotion, and specification state are preserved per selected stream.
- No secret, credential, absolute host path, path traversal, or symlink escape is present in the report.
- Every held main-agent lease was released and each refreshed stream states its `State revision`.

## Completion

Use [./templates/output.md](templates/output.md). Report the working tree each stream is worked in, the `overview.md` path, the stream count, per-stream updated state paths and work directory, classification and decision counts, and `generated_files`. `handover: complete` reports the successful pause once persistence and the `overview.md` upsert land; reserve `handover: blocked` for a failure that prevents persistence itself. Examples live in [./examples/invocations.md](examples/invocations.md).
