# Handoff

Create or execute a context-complete cross-domain plan. This skill owns
portable planning and coordinated execution; `essential:handover` instead
persists the current coding session in continuation files.

## Boundaries

- Use for: writing a plan another agent can execute without any of this
  session's context, and orchestrating a multi-domain plan's execution while
  retaining decision ownership.
- Do not use for: persisting a coding session for later continuation
  (`essential:handover`), or doing the planned work inline — execution is always
  delegated.

## Inputs

- **Required**: the work to plan, or an existing plan to execute.
- **Optional**: the `Workflow` tool for multi-phase execution; `coding:*`
  skills when available — confirm availability before routing to one,
  otherwise name the equivalent action or files without invoking it.
- **Required evidence for a persisted plan**: current repository root, active
  branch, base and HEAD commit SHAs, worktree status, relevant tool versions,
  exact command lines already run with outcomes, and absolute paths to every
  source artifact the next executor must use.

Before creating or materially rewriting a project artifact, read the absolute
`engineering-work.md` path injected by Essential. If unavailable, stop artifact
writes and report the missing contract. Resolve the active work directory from
that contract.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve material uncertainty.** Separate user-stated intent, observed
   evidence, inferences, accepted assumptions, and unresolved questions. Ask
   only questions whose answers change scope, architecture, acceptance
   criteria, sequencing, or another material decision; give a recommended
   answer and reason. Remaining uncertainty must be low-impact and reversible,
   explicitly deferred with an owner and decision deadline, or marked blocking.
2. **Write the plan as a zero-context handoff.** Open with a
   self-contained **Goal** block the user can copy and paste verbatim to
   initiate the work — it states the intended outcome fully on its own, without
   relying on your context. Then write the plan so an execution agent never has
   to rediscover basics. The persisted plan must include these named sections:
   - **Baseline** — exact repository root, active branch, base SHA, HEAD SHA,
     dirty-status summary, environment constraints, and every test, coverage,
     lint, build, or inspection command already run, with timestamps or run
     order, exit status, and concise output/result.
   - **Immutable Inputs** — exact absolute paths and repo-relative paths,
     filenames, artifact IDs, URLs, issue/PR IDs, data snapshots, and commit
     SHAs that define the work. Include file checksums when a referenced file
     lives outside the repository or may change independently.
   - **Current Decisions and Assumptions** — user-stated intent, observed
     evidence, accepted assumptions, unresolved questions, owners, deadlines,
     and the precise evidence that should trigger a plan pivot.
   - **Execution Environment and Tooling** — concrete shell commands for
     setup, dependency installation, code generation, tests, coverage, linters,
     formatters, previews, and verification. Commands must be copy-pasteable,
     include working directories and required environment variables, and name
     the expected pass/fail signal.
   - **Step-by-Step Implementation Plan** — ordered phases with exact files to
     read or edit, the reason each file matters, acceptance criteria per phase,
     and rollback/stop conditions.
   - **Dynamic Workflow Script** — when `Workflow` is appropriate, embed either
     a complete plain-JavaScript Workflow script or an exact durable script path
     plus its SHA-256 checksum and invocation arguments. The script must be
     concrete enough for the next agent to run as-is: no placeholders, no
     hidden context, deterministic inputs, explicit agent types, and validation
     against `plugins/essential/references/workflow-tool.md`. If `Workflow` is
     unavailable or inappropriate, include an equivalent sequential command plan
     instead.
   Avoid pronouns like "this", "that", "above", or "the current task" unless
   the noun is named in the same sentence. Prefer absolute paths plus
   repo-relative paths for handoff-critical files. When the plan must persist,
   write it to a lowercase `proposals/<plan-slug>.md` child with status `open`;
   the PM reconciles the lazy `proposals.md` overview. Update the child to
   `accepted` only after user approval.
3. **Execute as orchestrator** (when execution is requested). Run a
   multi-phase plan as a `Workflow` — one phase per stage, fanning out to
   subagents where a phase allows — instead of doing the work inline. Act as
   the orchestrator and decision maker only: route each phase to the right
   agent with complete context, synthesize the results, and make the calls.
   Delegate all execution — reading, writing, running, testing — to
   subagents; never do the work yourself. On completion, publish the compact
   transferable receipt to the owning task, PR, or Notion work item so another
   workspace can rehydrate without copying `.engineering/`.
4. Run the verification below; when a check fails, fix the cause and re-run
   that check. Repeat until every check passes or a concrete blocker remains,
   then report the blocker instead of looping.

## Verification

- The Goal block stands alone: pasted into a fresh session, it fully states
  the intended outcome.
- The plan has a **Baseline** section with exact paths, branch, base/HEAD SHAs,
  dirty status, commands, outcomes, and relevant output.
- A reader without this session's context could execute the plan — no step
  depends on unstated knowledge or rediscovery of paths, SHAs, filenames,
  commands, tools, or source artifacts.
- The plan embeds a complete dynamic Workflow script, or names the durable
  script path, checksum, and args; if Workflow is not used, it embeds the
  concrete sequential execution commands.
- Every residual unknown is accepted and reversible, explicitly deferred with
  an owner and deadline, or blocking; the plan names evidence that requires a
  pivot.
- When executed: every phase was delegated with complete context, and each
  phase's results were checked against the plan's success criteria before the
  next phase started.

## Completion

Report the plan's location and its Goal block, the decisions made while
planning, and — when executed — each phase's outcome and any open questions
or deviations from the plan. A blocked execution names the phase, what was
attempted, and what decision or input is needed to continue. Return explicit
final paths generated or materially rewritten as `generated_files`; the PM
size-checks only eligible work Markdown inside the target `.engineering/`.
