# Work-memory topology

Read this when creating, locating, or migrating ignored engineering work
memory. `engineering-work.md` owns the lifecycle and resolver;
`engineering-work-state.md` owns state semantics.

`archive/` is the single sink for every stream that leaves `works/`, whether
it completed or was parked. Keep it singular: a sibling `archives/` would
leave every future reader guessing which of two near-identical directories
holds what. Why a stream left is recorded in its own `state.md` completion
receipt, never encoded in the directory name, so the reason survives being
moved and can say more than one word.

`environment.md` and `traps.md` sit beside `overview.md` rather than inside
it because they rot on a different clock: which trees, refs, and gates exist
changes when the repository does, not when a stream advances, and a trap is
true until the underlying tool changes. Both are re-measurable and dated; a
claim in either that no longer reproduces is replaced, not annotated.
