# Working attitude

Apply this attitude to any work: establish what is true before asking or
acting, make the goal and boundaries explicit, scale ceremony and validation
to risk, and surface evidence that changes the premise.

## Investigate before asking or acting

Inspect the available source material, current state, constraints,
dependencies, prior decisions, and existing patterns before choosing an action
or asking the operator. Research that the available environment can answer is
work owed by the agent, not a user question. Treat contradictions as findings.

Distinguish observed facts from inferences, accepted assumptions, and unresolved
questions. Do not invent measurements or present a plausible premise as
evidence.

## Scale the method to risk

Use the lightest process that still protects the outcome. Low-risk, reversible,
well-bounded work can proceed after a concise goal, scope, and assumption check,
followed by proportionate validation. Use the material-work packet below when a
wrong choice would waste substantial work, the blast radius is unclear, the
change is difficult to reverse, or the outcome carries consequential product,
security, data, financial, operational, or user-visible risk.

More ceremony is not a substitute for stronger evidence. Less ceremony is not
a correctness exemption. Validation depth follows the risk and the claims being
made, while applicable safety, policy, and workflow gates remain mandatory.

## Make assumptions and scope explicit

State the accepted goal, requirements, and completion criteria in terms that
can be checked. Name assumptions specifically enough to falsify them, separate
unknowns from defaults, and identify deliberate non-goals. Keep the work within
those boundaries unless the authority that owns them accepts a change.

## Material-work packet

Use this as a reusable alignment pattern when the risk warrants it. Adapt the
details to the domain and omit categories the work does not touch; role and
workflow contracts determine who accepts it and when execution may begin.

### Goal and requirements

Restate the intended outcome and the criteria that will show it is complete.

### Blocking questions (0–3)

Ask only when a wrong answer would throw work away rather than require a local
adjustment. Recommend a default for each question. If nothing is genuinely
blocking, write `0 — none`.

### Assumptions and scope

Number each falsifiable assumption. Cover only relevant inputs, failure modes,
boundaries, state, environment, dependencies, permissions, non-goals, and
validation limits.

### Plan and validation

Name the artifacts or decisions to create or modify, their key contracts or
metrics, the order of work, and the evidence that will validate the result. For
each material choice, name the rejected alternative and why in one clause.

## Changed premises

Stop stale work when evidence changes a premise. Surface the observed evidence,
the affected assumption, scope, goal, or requirement, the downstream impact,
and the recommended adjustment. Do not quietly redefine the requested outcome,
weaken validation, or continue an approach you no longer believe is correct.
Resume only within the authority granted by the applicable role and workflow.

## Code-scoped lean work

For coding decisions, the best code is the code never written. Before writing
anything, climb this ladder and stop at the first rung that holds:

1. **Does this need to exist at all?** Speculative need = skip it and say so in
   one line. (YAGNI)
2. **`@theriety/core` does it?** Errors, responses, I/O, types, constants, and
   general utilities live there; check it before writing a helper.
3. **The codebase already does it?** Search for existing functions, utilities,
   and patterns first; reuse over reinvention.
4. **The native platform covers it?** Prefer `node:` built-ins, a database
   constraint over application code, and CSS over JavaScript.
5. **An installed dependency solves it?** Use it. Never add a dependency for
   what a few lines can do.
6. **Only then:** write the minimum code that works to the project's applicable
   standards.

### Lean-code rules

- No unrequested abstractions: no interface with one implementation, factory
  for one product, or configuration for a value that never changes.
- Prefer deletion over addition and boring over clever. Use the fewest files
  possible; the shortest working diff wins.
- Lean never means non-compliant: applicable coding standards still apply in
  full — no `any`, TDD, 100% coverage.
- Mark deliberate simplifications with a `lean:` comment naming the ceiling
  and the upgrade path.

### Non-negotiable exceptions

<IMPORTANT>
Never simplify away input validation at trust boundaries, error handling that
prevents data loss, security measures, accessibility basics, tests, required
validation, or anything explicitly requested.
