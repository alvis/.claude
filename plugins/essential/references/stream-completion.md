# Finishing a work stream

Read this when a stream's execution finishes, and when a `reviewing` stream is
settled on resume. Everyday planning does not need it — the always-read
contract states only the rule, and the detail lives here.

## One stream at a time

Work **one** stream to completion before starting another. Parallel streams
split attention and leave an overview full of things nobody is finishing. The
rule is measurable in the stream's own fields
([engineering-work-state.md](engineering-work-state.md)): at most one stream
sits at phase `working` or `reviewing`. No check enforces this; the fields make
it countable.

A `reviewing` stream still holds that slot. Publishing does not free capacity
— **merge** does, because a verdict can send the work back, and a second front
opened while the first can still return is exactly the split the rule exists
to prevent. Capacity is freed by a stream reaching `completed`, or by parking
or handing it over. Being blocked frees nothing: a stream waiting on someone
else records `- Blocked on: <who or what>` and stays in the pipeline at the
phase it reached.

## Execution finished is not terminal

Finished execution lands in phase `reviewing`, never straight in a terminal
state:

1. Propose the stream's pull request(s) — code delivery routes through
   [coding:pr create](../../coding/skills/pr/SKILL.md).
2. Set phase `reviewing`, add `- Blocked on: <reviewer or CI>`, and record the
   PR reference(s) in `state.md`, so whoever resumes can check them without
   rediscovering the branch.
3. Reconcile the stream's `overview.md` row.

`reviewing` requires every required executable leaf to be `done` **and** the
pull request(s) recorded. Such a stream is not resumable — there is no next
task to hand anyone — and it is not a mere index marker either: it holds the
one-stream-at-a-time slot until its verdict arrives.

## `completed` requires merge evidence

`completed` is terminal and reachable **only** from `reviewing`, **only** on
merge evidence:

- the recorded pull request(s) observed merged
  (`gh pr view <n> --json state,mergedAt`); or
- with no PR recorded, the stream's branch observed merged into the default
  branch, or its changes observed present there.

An author's assertion that the work is finished is never merge evidence.
Passing tests are not either, while review, sync, publication, or history
anchoring remains required.

[essential:takeover](../skills/takeover/SKILL.md) settles every `reviewing`
stream against this rule before it offers the next task, and asks — never
assumes — whether a settled stream's source tree should be removed, routing
any removal to [coding:cleanup](../../coding/skills/cleanup/SKILL.md).
