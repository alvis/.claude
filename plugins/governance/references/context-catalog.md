# Base-Context Catalog

This catalog owns role context assignments. Standards indexes own canonical names, paths, and task applicability; an agent never invents a standard or path.

## Rules

- **Role context is not task selection.** Each agent declares its role context from the assignment map below. At task time, select standards through `essential:directions/standards.md`; the role list does not exclude other applicable standards.
- **Repo-derived context is lazy.** The entries in the repo-derived menu are resolved per task, from whatever repo the agent is currently working in. They are NEVER preloaded at agent-definition time and never hold a fixed path in this catalog; an agent's base.md states that it resolves them lazily, not what they currently point to.
- **Every agent self-curates project memory.** Every roster definition carries `"memory": "project"` and owns `.claude/agent-memory/<name>/MEMORY.md`; there is no external memory steward or shared runtime memory file. Each definition names role-specific durable content and follows `essential:templates/memory.md` for evidence, verification, contradiction replacement, archival, size control, and sensitive-data exclusions.

## Standards menu

Standard names used in the assignment map below resolve through the standards indexes, which own the list, the paths, and the dependency edges: `coding:standards/INDEX.md`, `react:standards/INDEX.md`, `web:standards/INDEX.md`, and `governance:standards/INDEX.md`. An agent's `base.md` cites the path its owning index gives and never derives one. *The design standards* is this catalog's shorthand for `web:standards/{css,design, theming}/` plus `react:standards/{components,accessibility,hooks,project-structure,storybook}/`.

Selecting and applying a standard follows `essential:directions/standards.md`; this catalog says which agent gets which standards, not how they are applied.

### GAP note

No `authentication.md` or `data-protection.md` standard has been written anywhere in this repo. Any agent, template, or prior agent file that cites `authentication.md`, `data-protection.md`, `communication.md`,
`checklist.md`, `infrastructure.md`, `monitoring.md`, `deployment.md`, or `naming/README.md` is citing a standard <!-- doc-path-gate: ignore -->
that was never written — those are fake and MUST NOT appear in any agent's base context. Security- and data-protection-sensitive agents (e.g. `security-champion`) fall back to `code-review` + `universal` until a real auth/data-protection standard is authored; do not paper over the gap by inventing a path.

## Repo-derived menu (lazy — never preloaded, no fixed path here)

| Context | Resolves to (at task time, from the target repo) |
|---|---|
| Task area | The functional area/module the current task touches (its own conventions, siblings, existing patterns) |
| Repo configuration | The target repo's build/lint/test configuration (`package.json` scripts, tsconfig, eslint config, CI) |
| Handover notes | Any paused-work/design notes left for the current task (`essential:handover` output, design docs) |
| Repo-local standards | Additional repo-local standards, if the target repo defines any; they cannot replace canonical rule IDs or thresholds |

An agent's base.md names which of these it consults and states that resolution happens lazily per task — it never bakes in a repo path, because the agent is not scoped to one repo.

## Per-agent context assignment map

The table names each agent's role context. Producers also resolve the task area and repo configuration lazily; critics resolve the task area. Task-based standard selection follows the indexes.

| Agent | Standards subset |
|---|---|
| `principal-engineer` | `universal`, `function`, `typescript`, `observability`, `code-review` |
| `tech-lead` | `universal`, `code-review`, `git` |
| `code-quality-critic` | `code-review`, `universal`, `function`, `typescript` |
| `testing-evangelist` | `testing`, `function`, `typescript`, `code-review` |
| `security-champion` | `code-review`, `universal` |
| `data-architect` | `universal`, `typescript`, `naming` |
| `devops` | `universal`, `observability`, `git` |
| `ml-engineer` | `universal`, `python`, `function`, `testing`, `observability` |
| `ai-research-lead` | `universal`, `observability`, `code-review` |
| `generalist-engineer` | `universal`, `function`, `typescript`, `testing` |
| `design-lead` | `universal`, the design standards, `code-review` |
| `desktop-implementer` | `universal`, `function`, `typescript`, the design standards, `testing` |
| `mobile-implementer` | `universal`, `function`, `typescript`, the design standards, `testing` |
| `workflow-optimizer` | `universal`, `documentation` |
| `specification-expert` | `documentation`, `naming`, `universal` |
| `project-initializer` | `universal`, `file-structure`, `git` |
| `frontend-designer` | the design standards, `universal`, `typescript` |
| `frontend-implementer` | `universal`, `function`, `typescript`, the design standards, `testing` |
| `aesthetic-evaluator` | the design standards, `code-review` |
| `adversarial-red-team` | `code-review`, `universal` |
| `harness-eval-engineer` | `testing`, `universal`, `function`, `observability`, `code-review` |
| `test-runner` | `testing` |

Update this catalog when changing a role's context assignment, not when a task selects another applicable standard.

## How an agent cites this catalog

An agent's `base.md` Base Context section lists its role context by canonical name + real path from the owning index, states which repo-derived context it resolves lazily, and — if it carries a `memory` frontmatter key — states that it self-curates `.claude/agent-memory/<name>/MEMORY.md`. See `../skills/create-agent/templates/agent.md` for the required `## Memory` section, `essential:templates/memory.md` for its maintenance schema, and `../skills/create-agent/templates/role-prompt.md` for how the same context list is compressed into an `initialPrompt` load-context clause.
