# Claude Code, Codex, and Grok Build compatibility

Load this reference only when a Claude Code, Codex, or Grok Build difference affects a skill's execution, required tools, or validation.

## Behavior-affecting differences

- Explicit skill selection does not test implicit discovery. Use natural-language intent for agent activation guidance and trigger checks.
- Claude Code path substitutions and frontmatter extensions have no portable meaning. Do not put them in the shared `SKILL.md`.
- Resolve every supporting file from the skill root according to `references/authoring.md`.
- Do not translate a Claude-only control or runtime command into another harness's equivalent by analogy. Use only behavior documented by the target harness.
- Grok Build honors `allowed-tools`; we forbid it repo-wide for portability, so a shared skill never carries it under any harness.
- Grok Build ignores `SessionStart` and `SubagentStart` stdout, so no skill may depend on hook-injected context under it.

## Validation

After the portable checks in `references/authoring.md`, run the root `SKILL.md` verification command when the target includes Claude Code. This repository defines no general Codex or Grok Build validator or runtime evaluator for skills, so do not invent one. When an isolated check for another harness is unavailable, report the unverified behavior instead of substituting a Claude result.
