# Action: verify

Loaded by `SKILL.md` when the requested action is `verify`. Validate a new or changed skill; the shared policy, thought-experiment/blindspot test, and verification commands live in `SKILL.md`.

## Boundaries

- The Agent Skills specification owns the portable directory, required frontmatter, and supporting-file contract.
- Claude Code's validator owns Claude manifest and frontmatter schema correctness only.
- `quick_validate.ts` owns repository policies only; it must not duplicate the evolving Claude schema. Its default run delegates schema validation to Claude; `--policy-only` is the bounded path when that validator is not available.
- Codex and Grok Build validation use the documented Agent Skills contract and each harness's documented behavior. Do not invent a `codex plugin validate` command or infer support from a Claude-only field; Grok Build's documented `grok plugin validate` may be used where that CLI is installed.
- Functional and trigger checks are required when behavior or discovery changed, not for a wording-only edit with unchanged meaning.
- The cold-start release gate in `directions/functional-mode.md` applies to every `create`, operational `update`, and standalone verification claiming behavioral self-sufficiency. Optional harness runtime evaluation is a separate check.
- Structural mode checks structure and policy only. It may return structural `PASS`, but cannot claim behavioral or self-sufficiency validation.

## Inputs

- **Required**: a `SKILL.md`, skill directory, plugin, marketplace, or plugins path.
- **Required for functional or full mode**: representative tasks, raw inputs, expected outcomes, and acceptance checks. Derive missing tasks from the skill's promises and real consumers; if that is impossible, behavioral verification is incomplete.
- **Optional comparison evidence**: prior skill version, baseline ref, or diff. Use it to classify an update; its absence does not exempt functional or full verification from exercising the current skill.
- **Optional** mode: `structural`, `functional`, or `full` (default `full`).
- **Optional** representative prompts supplied inline and `runtime: true|false` (default `false`).
- **Optional** `fix: true|false` (default `false`) — apply fixes for reported causes and rerun the failed checks.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the target and enumerate affected skills and plugin roots. When comparison evidence exists, classify the change with `update` step 3; a semantic difference such as a changed command or configuration value is operational. Without comparison evidence, verify the requested properties of the current skill without inventing update history.
2. Validate the portable core and load `references/harnesses.md`. Run only the applicable checks for the target harnesses. Report unavailable commands as not run or blocked rather than substituting a private validator.
3. Resolve `scripts/quick_validate.ts` from the loaded `write-skill` root and invoke `--portable` separately for each enumerated skill file or directory. Review body length, description budget, root-contained references, and placeholders. Use `--policy-only` only when Claude validation is unavailable, and report that omission.
4. For create, operational update, and functional or full verification, resolve the representative tasks and apply the cold-start gate in `directions/functional-mode.md`. Structural-only verification skips execution and labels self-sufficiency `not_evaluated`.
5. For functional or full mode, derive a transient representative-case matrix from the owned outcome and any caller-supplied prompts. Keep it in context or a temporary Markdown scratch file in the OS temp folder (for example `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/check.md`). Follow `directions/functional-mode.md` for the case shape, paper-only reasoning, and optional isolated harness execution.
6. Include positive trigger prompts, nearby negative prompts, and behavior or failure cases relevant to the change. Separate reasoned outcomes from observed runtime evidence; a pass must not claim execution that did not run.
7. Aggregate evidence by skill and delete any temporary scratch file. When fixes are requested, change only reported causes and rerun the failed checks.

## Verification

After every fix iteration, re-run the verification commands in `SKILL.md`. Trigger and functional results must include the prompt, expectation, reasoned or observed outcome, and pass/fail rationale. A fix changes the current bytes and makes prior cold-start evidence stale; repeat step 4 before returning a verdict. When cold-start is applicable, do not return a passing verdict unless its release gate passes.

## Completion

Apply the root completion contract. Return separate structural and behavioral verdicts so a structural pass cannot be mistaken for self-sufficiency evidence.
