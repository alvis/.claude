# Transient Paper, Cold-Start, Functional, and Trigger Checks

Loaded by the `verify` action for transient functional and trigger checks, and by `create`, operational `update`, and `verify` for the mandatory cold-start check below. Cold-start proves product self-sufficiency; the optional harness exercise tests activation and runtime behavior. They are separate checks.

<IMPORTANT>
- Keep cases in context. If written notes help, use a Markdown table in an OS temporary directory and delete it before staging or committing.
- Label paper-only conclusions as `reasoned`. Reserve `observed` for commands that executed in an isolated runtime and outputs from a fresh-agent cold-start session. Every cold-start status must cite the evidence or blocking cause defined below.
</IMPORTANT>

## Build the paper representative-case matrix

Use caller-supplied prompts first, then derive only the missing coverage from the skill's owned outcome, description, boundaries, workflow, and neighboring skills. Keep the matrix small and change-focused:

- one direct positive request for the owned outcome;
- one paraphrased positive request when discovery wording changed;
- one nearby negative request owned by a neighboring skill;
- one behavior, missing-input, failure, or verification-shortcut case relevant to the changed workflow.

For each case record the prompt, expected owner, expected behavior, evidence to inspect, and whether the result is reasoned or observed. `mode=functional` may omit discovery-only cases; `mode=full` includes both trigger and behavior coverage. These rows are thought-experiment evidence; never title or report this matrix as cold-start evidence.

## Run the paper-only blindspot check

Compare every prompt with the target description, explicit boundaries, and the closest competing skill descriptions. Then trace the expected behavior through the target workflow and verification contract. A reasoned pass requires:

- positive prompts clearly belong to the target;
- near misses clearly belong elsewhere and are not stolen by broad wording;
- required inputs and failure behavior are explicit;
- shortcuts cannot bypass required verification;
- the expected outcome is supported by instructions or deterministic scripts, not by an unstated assumption.

Fix a discovered blindspot in the owning instruction, rerun the affected cases, and bound the loop to two iterations. Paper reasoning does not establish actual skill invocation or runtime output in any harness.

## Run the cold-start release gate

<IMPORTANT>
Cold-start is required for every create, operational update, and verification claiming behavioral self-sufficiency. Paper reasoning, structural validators, and optional harness activation checks cannot replace it.
</IMPORTANT>

Use the representative tasks from [authoring.md](../references/authoring.md#reusable-knowledge-target). For each task, launch a fresh agent or isolated session with only the complete skill directory and the raw prompt or disposable fixtures an ordinary caller would provide. Do not supply authoring notes, expected answers, evaluation criteria, or the diagnosis that motivated the change.

Record one compact evidence row per task:

- the promise being tested, task, expected outcome, and session identifier;
- the supplied skill revision or SHA-256 directory digest, plus the exact skill paths the task depended on and SHA-256 digests for those files, the prompt, and fixtures;
- the session's final response, produced artifacts, and a concise action/tool account when the interface exposes one;
- an attribution check for every task-critical decision that depends on the skill's promised reusable knowledge, mapping it to supplied skill text, a supplied raw input, a source the skill explicitly directs the agent to inspect, or the acceptance oracle; and
- a separate observed outcome check using the strongest available oracle:

  - an exact acceptance command, exit status, and relevant output;
  - an identified oracle and its comparison result; or
  - explicit inspection criteria and the observed result for each criterion.

A digest proves identity, not correctness. Prefer deterministic or independent oracles when they exist; author-written inspection criteria are a fallback and must map to the skill's stated promises. Assign status as follows:

- `passed` — the task meets its oracle, every task-critical skill-owned decision is attributable as above, and the session did not research or reconstruct omitted mechanics, setup, commands, or decision rules. Research required by the task or an explicit skill instruction is allowed.
- `failed` — the session ran but missed the oracle, made an unattributed task-critical skill-owned decision, researched or reconstructed omitted skill-owned mechanics, inferred omitted setup, or exposed another self-sufficiency gap. Cite the symptom and owning instruction to change.
- `blocked` — the caller prohibited the fresh-session check, the mechanism failed, or an external prerequisite that the skill correctly declares was observably unavailable. Cite the attempted mechanism or prerequisite check and report self-sufficiency as unverified.

Build a directory digest from a path-sorted manifest of every supplied file's relative path and SHA-256 digest over its exact bytes, then SHA-256 that manifest. Evidence may be reused when the task, expected outcome, oracle, prompt and fixture digests, evaluator contract, and every recorded dependency-path digest match. A changed directory digest triggers dependency comparison: invalidate a row when one of its recorded paths changed or when the agent cannot prove the change is irrelevant to that task. Keep evidence outside the target skill and repository; the caller may retain the compact manifest and referenced outputs for later verification under its own storage policy.

Use read-only tasks or disposable fixtures unless the caller authorized side effects. Unless the caller prohibited the attempt, run the fresh-session mechanism or the skill's declared check for an external prerequisite before reporting `blocked`; report the observed constraint or failure with self-sufficiency as unverified. An unattempted or undeclared prerequisite claim is not blocking evidence. A paper-only pass cannot replace the check or be reported as `passed`. Revise the owning instruction or resource, rerun structural validation and affected paper cases, then rerun only the invalidated task. Allow at most two attempts per task; report the remaining gap instead of nesting another verification loop.

## Optionally exercise an available harness

Run executable cases only when `runtime: true` and the target harness provides a documented isolated evaluation mechanism. Use one fresh session per prompt and a natural-language request that expresses the representative intent without naming or explicitly selecting the skill. Compare observed activation and output with the case expectation. If no such evaluator is available, report runtime as `blocked` with the missing prerequisite; do not translate another harness's command by analogy or weaken the expected result.

This optional exercise does not produce or replace cold-start evidence. A harness runtime result may be `not requested` while required cold-start tasks still pass, and a cold-start task cannot pass merely because the harness exercise passed.

## Report and clean up

Return one row per paper case with prompt, expected owner/behavior, evidence kind, outcome, and rationale. For cold-start, return the compact evidence rows, per-task status, and aggregate status; aggregate passes only when every task passes. Report optional harness runtime separately. Delete temporary scratch notes, but preserve any caller-owned reusable evidence bundle according to its storage policy.
