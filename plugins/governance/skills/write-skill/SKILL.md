# Write Skill

Author, revise, and validate Agent Skills. One skill, three actions: `create` a new skill, `update` one or more existing skills, or `verify` a skill's structural, policy, and trigger compliance. Infer the action from the user's stated intent, then route to its reference below and follow that workflow.

## Actions

- **`create`** — Add a new reusable skill that teaches a missing behavior with clear ownership and triggers. See [create.md](directions/create.md).
- **`update`** — Revise existing skill behavior, wording, or triggers, or align skills with current policy, without creating a competing skill. See [update.md](directions/update.md).
- **`verify`** — Validate structural, repository-policy, and (when behavior or discovery changed) trigger and behavior compliance, optionally exercising isolated harness prompts. See [verify.md](directions/verify.md).

If the action is missing or ambiguous, ask which action is intended rather than guessing. `create` requires that no suitable owner exists; when one does, switch to `update`. `create` and `update` call the `verify` action for functional and trigger evaluation.

## Shared policy

Follow [authoring.md](references/authoring.md) for all three actions. Load [harnesses.md](references/harnesses.md) only when a Claude Code, Codex, or Grok Build difference affects execution, required tools, or validation.

## Shared thought experiment and blindspot test

Whenever an action changes a trigger or behavior, conduct a paper-only thought experiment and blindspot test over positive and near-miss prompts before and after the change. Record the prompt, expected owner and behavior, evidence kind, outcome, and rationale in context. If written notes help, keep them in an OS temporary directory and delete them before staging. Do not claim runtime behavior was exercised unless an executable evaluation actually ran.

## Verification

Resolve `scripts/quick_validate.ts` from this skill's root—the directory containing this loaded `SKILL.md`—rather than from the process working directory. For each affected skill, set `TARGET` to its exact `SKILL.md` or skill directory and run one invocation:

```bash
bun run "<loaded-write-skill-root>/scripts/quick_validate.ts" --portable "$TARGET"
```

Portable mode rejects required Markdown links outside the skill root and checks root-relative links in `references/`. The script resolves a containing Claude plugin through the target's ancestors and validates it when present. Complete the checks in [authoring.md](references/authoring.md) and any applicable harness checks in [harnesses.md](references/harnesses.md) after every fix iteration. When a check fails, change only the reported cause and re-run that check; loop fix and re-verify at most 3 times, then report partial completion with the remaining issues.

## Completion

<IMPORTANT>
A `create`, operational `update`, or verification claiming behavioral self-sufficiency cannot return `PASS` from paper reasoning or validators. Apply the [cold-start release gate](directions/functional-mode.md#run-the-cold-start-release-gate) to every representative task. A standalone structural verification may report structural `PASS`, but must state that self-sufficiency was not evaluated.
</IMPORTANT>

Report the action taken, affected skill paths, ownership boundaries or changes, reusable knowledge target, thought-experiment and blindspot coverage, structural validation, behavioral gate status and session IDs when applicable, optional harness runtime status, and unresolved ambiguity. The behavioral report schema and evidence currency rules live only in `directions/functional-mode.md`. Confirm any temporary Markdown thought-experiment notes were deleted before commit. Never claim a bulk update without listing its targets.
