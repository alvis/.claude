name: create-standard
description: Create a new technical standard at a plugin's canonical standards root using meta.md, scan.md, write.md, and per-rule guides. Use when establishing new coding standards, documenting technical requirements, or creating compliance guidelines for reusable policy with explicit dependencies, detection, compliant patterns, and stable rule IDs. Route existing-standard revisions to update-standard.

# Create Standard

Set `GOVERNANCE_CREATE_STANDARD_SKILL_DIR` to the absolute directory containing this loaded `SKILL.md` before invoking its validator.

Create exactly one new directory at `plugins/<plugin>/standards/<standard-name>/` holding the three-tier standard (meta.md, scan.md, write.md, rules/). `update-standard` owns revisions to existing standards.

## Boundaries

- Use for: establishing a missing reusable policy as a new standard with a unique rule-ID prefix.
- Do not use for: revising an existing standard (`update-standard`), creating skills (`write-skill`), writing to a repository-level shorthand root, overwriting an existing directory, or policy that belongs to an existing owner.

## Inputs

- **Required**: the target plugin and a lowercase kebab-case standard name, plus enough policy intent to define scope and rules.
- **Optional**: `--detail=...` with domain specifics that shape examples and rule guidance.
- **Prerequisites**: the installed governance templates [standard-meta.md](../../skills/create-standard/templates/standard-meta.md), [standard-scan.md](../../skills/create-standard/templates/standard-scan.md), and [standard-write.md](../../skills/create-standard/templates/standard-write.md); the target plugin's [standards index](../../standards/INDEX.md) pattern; and the selection protocol at `essential:directions/standards.md`.

## Workflow

1. Read all three tier templates, the target plugin's workflow references, and neighboring standards. Search every standard under `plugins/*/standards/` for the proposed prefix and rule IDs. Reject a duplicate target, duplicate prefix/ID, unknown plugin, missing templates, or policy that belongs to an existing owner.
2. Define scope, non-goals, dependent standards, stricter requirements, exception policy, rule groups, and stable IDs before drafting examples. The rule prefix is a unique short uppercase mnemonic.
3. Create the target directory and `rules/`. Populate `meta.md` from the meta template: explanatory relationships use `standard:<name>` within the plugin or `plugin:<plugin>:standard:<name>` across plugins; every declared group matches the chosen prefix.
4. Populate `scan.md` from the scan template. Every quick-scan item and matrix row names one declared rule ID and describes a mechanically or reviewably detectable violation. Put mandatory inputs, runtime/tool prerequisites, and before-mutation checks on this entry path.
5. Populate `write.md` from the write template. Every rule ID has actionable compliant guidance; patterns and decisions do not contradict scan criteria.
6. Create `rules/<lowercase-rule-id>.md` for every rule that requires detail. Link it from the tiers using relative links and ensure no guide introduces an undeclared ID.
7. Remove all template placeholders and instructions. Keep examples only when they disambiguate detection or compliance.
8. Register the standard as a row in `plugins/<plugin>/standards/INDEX.md`, naming what it applies to and its directory. Preserve applicable cross-standard requirements in the INDEX selection or independent scan triggers with canonical rule-guide links. References cannot authorize loading an undeclared plugin. An unindexed standard is never selected.
9. Run the verification below; when a check fails, fix the cause and re-run that check. Repeat until every check passes or a concrete blocker remains, then report the blocker instead of looping.

## Verification

- Cross-tier consistency: build sets of IDs from meta groups, scan bullets/matrix, write summaries, and rule filenames. Fail when an ID is undeclared, missing from scan or write, duplicated, uses another prefix, or links to a missing guide.
- The INDEX row exists and names this standard's directory.
- Walk a clean candidate from INDEX through scan: mandatory checks must be reached without an exception or violation. Walk a violating candidate to its guide using the actual filename case, or to write when no guide exists.
- Resolve every local Markdown link from its containing file. Verify dependent-standard targets exist and no dependency cycle is introduced.
- Run `claude plugin validate --strict plugins/<plugin>` and `bun run "${GOVERNANCE_CREATE_STANDARD_SKILL_DIR}/../write-skill/scripts/quick_validate.ts" plugins/<plugin>` for repository policy checks.
- Exercise at least one violating and one compliant example per rule group against the scan/write guidance.

## Completion

Return the target path, source templates, prefix, complete rule-ID list, dependency and link check results, validation commands with their results, and any unresolved policy questions.
