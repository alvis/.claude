description: Update explicitly selected agent definitions to the current split-source template or a stated behavior change while preserving useful role expertise, trigger boundaries, context, collaboration links, and working voice. Use when migrating agents to a template revision, correcting agent configuration, or batch-updating selected agents; require an exact selector and route genuinely new roles to create-agent.

# Update Agent

Find selected source sets under `plugins/*/agents/<name>/`, then update their `base.md` and split `frontmatter/{meta,claude,codex,grok}.json` to the current template or a stated behavior change. `create-agent` owns genuinely new roles.

## Boundaries

- Use for: bounded template migrations and explicit corrections to explicitly selected agent definitions.
- Do not use for: creating a new role (`create-agent`), deleting agents, "modernizing" role-specific prose into template boilerplate, or changing protected fields the request did not authorize.
- An empty selector never means all; intentional repository-wide work requires explicit `--all`.

## Inputs

- **Required**: an agent path, name, or glob — or explicit `--all`.
- **Optional**: `--changes=...` describing the requested behavior, configuration, or template migration.
- **Owner token**: paths and ownership use the source-directory name under `plugins/` (for example, `coding`).
- **Prerequisites**: the [agent template](../../skills/create-agent/templates/agent.md), `role-prompt.md` beside it, and the [context catalog](../../references/context-catalog.md). Follow the [authoring standard](../../standards/authoring/).

## Workflow

1. Search every plugin's `agents/` directory for the selector. Read the agent template, `role-prompt.md`, the context catalog, the owning plugin's `hooks/ALLAGENT.md`, relevant team edges, every selected source set, and real callers. List exact targets before mutation. Reject missing or malformed source sets, ambiguous globs, locked/in-use targets, or a request that actually creates a new role.
2. Snapshot each target before editing:
   - owned outcome, positive/negative triggers, expertise, role-specific working voice, and stop rule;
   - exact standards and repo-derived context, collaboration/spawn edges, and skills/MCP/hooks;
   - fixed intelligence level, permissionMode, absence of a tools allowlist, memory, isolation, background, maxTurns, and `initialPrompt`;
   - the explicit requested changes and the protected fields not authorized to change.
3. Re-evaluate the role classification and launch scenario against [intelligence.md](../create-agent/directions/intelligence.md) (intelligence level, permissionMode, runtime tool inheritance, memory, and isolation criteria). Change those fields only when the requested migration or template requires it; report every such change.
4. Reconcile `frontmatter/meta.json`, `claude.json`, `codex.json`, and `grok.json` with their ownership boundaries. Metadata contains only `name`, `description`, and `intelligence`; harness files contain only harness-specific fields; `grok.json` stays present and `{}` unless a native Grok Build field applies — frontmatter hooks remain Claude-only by construction because Grok Build forbids them in agent frontmatter. Remove obsolete keys only with evidence. Always omit `tools` so runtime-provided capabilities remain visible; encode leaf and delegation posture in the role charter and shared orchestration rules. Use `disallowedTools` only for narrow durable restrictions on read-mostly roles, never as a general allowlist. Drop any leftover review-routing Stop hook: independent review is carried by the role's charter and convergence predicate plus Essential's shared orchestration policy, so no agent re-enforces it per task.
5. Reconcile `base.md` with the required functional sections while preserving expertise and voice: integrate approved changes into the existing prose and remove superseded instructions — never append an update log or second personality. Keep definition paths, frontmatter names, headings, and identity prose role-only; descriptions end with exactly three distinct preferred short names for main-agent teammate naming. Correct context aliases against the catalog. Keep Collaboration to concise outbound collaborator/delegation bullets, referencing each known agent's role-only name and main task. Do not duplicate Essential's shared runtime discovery, handoff, scripted-execution proxy, spawn-budget, or independent-review policy. Keep one H1 title and no source intelligence line; the stitcher derives exactly one matching line in each rendered definition from `meta.json`.
6. Rewrite `initialPrompt` from `role-prompt.md` whenever the role's first move, the artifact/brief it needs, or its guardrail changed. It must remain a 2-4 sentence no-task first-turn directive (first move → wait → deferred context + guardrail), must not restate identity, announce no task, or preload standards, and must agree exactly with `base.md`.
7. Recheck positive and near-miss triggers against neighboring agents and real dispatch sites through a paper-only thought experiment and blindspot test. If notes are written down, keep them temporary as a Markdown scratch document in an OS temp folder (for example `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/check.md`) using [check reference](../../templates/check.md) as the example table format with `:white_check_mark:`/`:x:` status markers, and delete them before staging; they are not deliverables and must not be committed. Keep the task-to-agent row in the owning plugin's `hooks/ALLAGENT.md` aligned with the resulting trigger surface; do not create a central routing table or widen role ownership incidentally.
8. Independent targets may be delegated per [delegation guidance](../../standards/delegation/) in bounded batches — one agent source set per subagent, never exceeding the declared task-wide child-spawn budget (default three new children) — but each assignment must name exact source sets and protected behavior. Review the integrated diff for cross-agent trigger and edge conflicts.
9. Run the verification below; when a check fails, fix the cause and re-run that check. Repeat until every check passes or a concrete blocker remains, then report the blocker instead of looping.

## Verification

- Run Essential's deterministic stitch helper three times for every selected source set, writing only separate temporary outputs, and inspect all three generated definitions: `bun run plugins/essential/skills/install/scripts/stitch_agent.ts plugins/<owner>/agents/<name> --harness claude --output <temporary-claude-path>`, `bun run plugins/essential/skills/install/scripts/stitch_agent.ts plugins/<owner>/agents/<name> --harness codex --output <temporary-codex-path>`, and `bun run plugins/essential/skills/install/scripts/stitch_agent.ts plugins/<owner>/agents/<name> --harness grok --output <temporary-grok-path>`.
- Always parse all four JSON files with `uv run --python 3.13 python -m json.tool`, check for placeholders, and validate the key surface, intelligence level, permission values, tool/spawn posture, context paths, namespaced skills, MCP/hooks, initialPrompt/base consistency, trigger separation, and the owning plugin routing row. Do not claim official runtime validation unless the installed loader was actually run.

## Completion

Return the selector, targets, preserved role traits, changed fields, trigger examples, thought-experiment and blindspot coverage, validation evidence, runtime-loading status, confirmation that temporary Markdown thought-experiment notes were deleted before commit, and unresolved issues. Completion requires every selected source set to validate and no unrequested role, voice, permission, or ownership change.
