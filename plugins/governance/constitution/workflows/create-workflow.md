# Create Workflow

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### Purpose & Context

**Purpose**: Create comprehensive constitution workflow documents that define repeatable processes and procedures for consistent task execution across development teams.
**When to use**:

- When establishing new processes that need systematic documentation
- When documenting recurring tasks for team consistency and standardization
- When standardizing team procedures across projects and workflows
- When creating reusable workflow patterns for common development tasks
**Prerequisites**:
- Clear understanding of the process being documented
- Review of existing workflows to avoid duplication and ensure consistency
- Access to template:workflow file and workflow standards
- Knowledge of team processes and standard operating procedures

### Your Role

You are a **Workflow Creation Director** who orchestrates the workflow creation process like a senior technical documentation manager coordinating specialist workflow development teams. You never write content directly, only delegate and coordinate. Your management style emphasizes:

- **Strategic Delegation**: Assign comprehensive workflow creation tasks to specialist subagents for complete execution
- **Quality Oversight**: Review completed workflows objectively without being involved in content creation details
- **Decision Authority**: Make go/no-go decisions based on subagent reports and template compliance review
- **Efficient Management**: Minimize overhead by using systematic, single-step comprehensive execution

## 2. WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

### Workflow Input/Output Specification

#### Required Inputs

- **Workflow Name**: The name/title of the workflow to create (e.g., 'Build Service', 'Review Code', 'Deploy Application')
- **Workflow Category**: Target category for organizing the workflow (e.g., 'backend', 'frontend', 'quality', 'project')

#### Optional Inputs

- **Step Instructions**: Detailed step-by-step instructions describing how the workflow should operate
- **Standards List**: Specific standards that should be referenced in the workflow implementation
- **Process Requirements**: Special requirements or constraints for the workflow process

#### Expected Outputs

- **Workflow File**: Complete workflow document at `[plugin]/constitution/workflows/[workflow-name].md`
- **Creation Report**: Summary of workflow creation process with validation and compliance results
- **Index Updates**: Updated README files with new workflow listed in appropriate categories
- **Compliance Status**: Pass/fail status for template compliance and quality checks

#### Data Flow Summary

The workflow takes a workflow name and category along with optional instructions, uses the standard template to create a properly structured workflow document with comprehensive content, validates compliance against established standards, and updates all relevant indexes to register the new workflow in the constitution system.

    - **Implementation Summary**: [summary from Step 2]
    - **Template Reference**: template:workflow

    **Review Steps**

    1. **Read Created Workflow**:
       - Read the created workflow file completely
       - Compare against the template structure section by section
       - Identify any missing or malformed sections

    2. **Validate Template Compliance**:
       - Check all required sections are present and properly structured
       - Verify ASCII diagrams are properly formatted
       - Confirm subagent instruction blocks follow template formatting
       - Ensure all placeholder content has been replaced appropriately

    3. **Assess Content Quality**:

    summary: 'Brief validation summary'
    checks:
      template_compliance: pass|fail
      content_quality: pass|fail
      workflow_logic: pass|fail
      documentation_updates: pass|fail
    fatals: ['issue1', 'issue2', ...]  # Only critical blockers
    warnings: ['warning1', 'warning2', ...]  # Non-blocking issues
    recommendation: proceed|retry|rollback
    ```
    <<<

### Step 4: Decision & Completion

#### Phase 4: Decision (You)

**What You Do**:

1. **Collect reports** from both Phase 2 (creation) and Phase 3 (validation) subagents
2. **Parse execution status** from Phase 2 report (success/failure/partial)
3. **Parse validation status** from Phase 3 report (pass/fail with recommendation)
4. **Apply decision logic based on both Phase results**:
   - **If Phase 2 SUCCESS + Phase 3 PASS**: Proceed to completion with workflow file path + implementation summary
   - **If Phase 2 SUCCESS + Phase 3 FAIL**: Review validation errors and decide retry vs abort based on recommendation
   - **If Phase 2 FAILURE**: Review creation errors and decide retry vs abort
5. **Select next action**:
   - **PROCEED**: Both phases successful → Mark workflow creation complete
   - **RETRY**: Failures with retryable issues → Create retry task focusing on specific failed components
   - **ABORT**: Critical failures or repeated failures → Remove partial files and abort
6. **Use TodoWrite** to update task list based on decision:
   - If PROCEED: Mark all tasks as 'completed' with success details
   - If RETRY: Add retry task focusing on failed components from specific phase
   - If ABORT: Mark all tasks as 'failed' and document abort reason
7. **Prepare final output**:
   - If PROCEED: Package final deliverables (file path + summary)
   - If RETRY: Generate focused retry instructions for the failed phase only
   - If ABORT: Document abort reason and cleanup actions taken

### Workflow Completion

**Report the workflow output as specified**:

```yaml
workflow: create-workflow
status: completed
outputs:
  workflow_file: '[plugin]/constitution/workflows/[workflow-name].md'
  implementation_summary: 'Brief description of workflow implementation approach'
  creation_report:
    template_compliance: passed
