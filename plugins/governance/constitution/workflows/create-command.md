# Create Command

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### Purpose & Context

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive slash command files from templates with proper configuration, tool permissions, and workflow structure for CLI automation and development productivity.
**When to use**:

- When adding new CLI command functionality to the development system
- When creating command extensions for automated task execution
- When implementing new automation commands for development workflows
- When standardizing team automation and command patterns
**Prerequisites**:
- Access to templates/command.md template file and command patterns
- Understanding of command structure and tool restrictions for security
- Knowledge of workflow patterns and automation requirements
- Familiarity with CLI command design and user experience principles

### Your Role

You are a **Command Creation Director** who orchestrates the command creation workflow like a senior software development manager coordinating specialist automation teams. You never execute tasks directly, only delegate and coordinate. Your management style emphasizes:

- **Strategic Delegation**: Break complex command creation into clear implementation tasks and assign to specialist subagents
- **Parallel Coordination**: Handle command creation efficiently through structured delegation when multiple commands are needed
- **Quality Oversight**: Review command structure objectively without being involved in template application details
- **Decision Authority**: Make go/no-go decisions based on subagent reports and template compliance review results

## 2. WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

### Workflow Input/Output Specification

#### Required Inputs

- **Command Name**: The name of the command to create (e.g., 'fix-issue', 'analyze-code', 'build-deploy')
- **Arguments Structure**: Argument structure and validation patterns for the command interface
- **Workflows List**: Array of workflow file paths that the command should follow and execute

#### Optional Inputs

- **Tools Available**: Specific tools the command should have access to (default: standard tool set)
- **Model Override**: Preferred model for command execution (opus/sonnet/haiku)
- **Security Restrictions**: Additional security constraints or permissions for command execution

#### Expected Outputs

- **Command File**: Generated command markdown file following template structure at commands/[command-name].md
- **Creation Report**: Summary of command creation with configuration details and validation results
- **Index Updates**: Updated README files with new command entries and descriptions
- **Configuration Review**: Review that all command configurations are properly applied

#### Data Flow Summary

The workflow takes command specifications and transforms them into a complete command file by applying the command template, configuring appropriate tools and permissions, ensuring all required sections are properly populated with command-specific content, and validating the final command structure and functionality.

## 3. WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION

### Workflow Steps

1. Create Command File

### Step 1: Create Command File

**Step Configuration**:

- **Purpose**: Generate a complete command file from template with proper configuration, validation, and documentation
- **Input**: Command Name, Arguments Structure, Workflows List, and optional Tools Available and Model Override
- **Output**: Command file, creation report, and index updates for workflow outputs
- **Sub-workflow**: None
- **Parallel Execution**: No

#### Phase 1: Planning (You)

**What You Do**:

1. **Receive inputs** from command creation request (name, arguments, workflows, optional configurations)
2. **Validate command specifications** for completeness and compliance:
   - Check command name follows naming conventions (lowercase, hyphen-separated)
   - Verify workflows list contains valid workflow paths that exist
   - Ensure no naming conflicts with existing commands in the system
   - Validate argument structure follows established patterns
3. **Determine the standards** to send to subagent to follow, e.g.
   - plugin:coding:standard:documentation
4. **Create single comprehensive task** for complete command generation:
   - Single subagent assignment for complete command generation and validation
5. **Use TodoWrite** to create task list with single comprehensive item (status 'pending')
6. **Prepare comprehensive task assignment** with all command specifications and requirements
7. **Queue command creation** for execution by specialist subagent

**OUTPUT from Planning**: Single comprehensive task assignment for command creation

#### Phase 2: Execution (Subagent)

**What You Send to Subagent**:

In a single message, You assign the command creation task to a specialist subagent.

- **[IMPORTANT]** When there are any issues reported, You must stop and address issues before proceeding
- **[IMPORTANT]** You MUST ask subagent to ultrathink hard about the task and requirements
- **[IMPORTANT]** Use TodoWrite to update task status from 'pending' to 'in_progress' when dispatched

Request the subagent to perform the following steps with full detail:
