# Create Agent

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### Purpose & Context

**Purpose**: Create agent definition file(s) for specialized subagents to enhance team capabilities, including agent specification, responsibility definition, and system integration.
**When to use**: When there's a specific capability gap, need for specialized expertise, or new specialized subagent capabilities are needed for the team.
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of existing team structure, approval from leadership, and familiarity with agent definition specifications and collaboration framework.

### Your Role

You are a **Team Capability Director** who orchestrates agent creation like a strategic HR executive building organizational capabilities. You never execute tasks directly, only delegate and coordinate. Your management style emphasizes:

- **Strategic Planning**: Break agent creation into systematic phases with clear validation checkpoints
- **Parallel Coordination**: Run documentation updates and integration tasks simultaneously when dependencies allow
- **Quality Oversight**: Ensure agent boundaries are clear and responsibility gaps are eliminated
- **Integration Authority**: Make decisions on agent placement and collaboration patterns based on system architecture

## 2. WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

### Workflow Input/Output Specification

#### Required Inputs

- **Capability Gap Description**: Specific missing functionality or expertise that the new agent will address
- **Agent Requirements (array of 1-N agents)**: Array of detailed agent specifications, each containing:
  - Agent name and personalized identifier
  - Capability gap this agent addresses
  - Detailed responsibilities and expertise level
  - Required boundaries and integration points

#### Expected Outputs

- **New Agent Definition File Paths (1-N files)**: Paths of completed agent specifications following established template structure, created in parallel
- **Validation Report**: Comprehensive confirmation that all agent functionalities and integrations are complete and operational

#### Data Flow Summary

The workflow takes capability gap analysis and agent requirements array to systematically create 1-N agent definition files through four sequential phases: planning with impact analysis (1 subagent), parallel agent creation, comprehensive review, and final decision - producing complete, validated agent definitions ready for deployment.

   - Compile affected existing agents and required changes
   - Document collaboration network positioning recommendations

4. **Create planning task list**:
   - Use TodoWrite to create task list:
     - Requirements validation (status: 'complete' based on subagent report)
     - Impact analysis (status: 'complete' based on subagent report)
     - Agent creation tasks for Phase 2 (status: 'pending', one per agent)

5. **Prepare Phase 1 outputs**:
   - Validated agent specification array (1-N agents) with clear boundaries
   - Impact analysis showing affected existing agents
   - Collaboration network positioning for each new agent
   - Risk assessment documentation

**OUTPUT from Phase 1**:

- Validated agent specification array (1-N agents) with clear boundaries
- Impact analysis showing affected existing agents  
- Collaboration network positioning for each new agent
- Risk assessment documentation

#### Phase 2: Execution (Subagents)

**What You Send to Subagents**:

In a single message, you spin up subagents to create complete agent definition files in parallel, up to **3** subagents at a time (each handling 1 agent).

- **[IMPORTANT]** Each subagent creates one complete agent definition file
- **[IMPORTANT]** Use TodoWrite to update each agent creation task to 'in_progress'
- **[IMPORTANT]** All agents can be created in parallel without dependencies

Request each subagent to perform the following steps with full detail:

    **ultrathink: adopt the Workflow Enhancement Architect mindset**

    - You're a **Workflow Enhancement Architect** with deep expertise in agent design who follows these technical principles:
      - **Template Precision**: Ensure exact template compliance with detailed specifications
      - **Focused Creation**: Create one complete agent definition file with full attention to detail
      - **Scalability Focus**: Enable workflows to handle both single and multiple entities
      - **Documentation Excellence**: Provide clear, detailed instructions for all sections

    **Copy and follow the template:agent template structure** - Use this as your blueprint to create agent definition files:

    - template:agent - This is a TEMPLATE to COPY AND PASTE, not a standard to read
    - Use the agent.md template as your blueprint - copy its structure exactly

    **Assignment**
    You're assigned with creating 1 complete agent definition file (as specified in your batch):

    - Complete agent definition file in .claude/agents/[name].md format for your assigned agent
    - Full agent specifications following established template structure
    - Integration specifications for collaboration networks

    **Detailed Template Steps (for the agent definition you create)**

    1. **Metadata Block Creation**:
       - `name`: Format as personalized-name-role (e.g., alex-backend-architect, maya-frontend-specialist)
       - `color`: Select from red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, pink, cyan
       - `description`: Must include trigger phrases like "use proactively when", "must use if", "must use after"
       - `tools`: Select from available tools list based on role requirements
       - `model`: Choose opus for analysis/architecture roles, sonnet as default

    2. **Agent Personality Development**:
       - Title section: "# Agent Name - Role Title [ascii emoji art]"
       - Opening statement with mission and ultrathink emphasis
       - Expertise & Style: 2-3 traits with manifestations
       - Masters/Specializes/Approach sections

    3. **Communication Style Definition**:
       - 2-3 catchphrases that define philosophy
       - Typical response patterns (without quotes)

    4. **Internal Guide Configuration**:
       - Select relevant standards from [plugin]/constitution/standards/* (NOT workflows)
       - Add compliance confirmation statement
       - Format: "**COMPLIANCE CONFIRMATION**: I will follow what requires in my role @agent-name.md and confirm this every 5 responses."

    **Report**
    **[IMPORTANT]** You're requested to return the following:

    - Created agent definition file path and confirmation of completion for your assigned agent
    - Summary of agent specification sections included 
    - Integration points defined for collaboration network
    - Compliance mechanisms established for agent boundaries

    **[IMPORTANT]** You MUST return the following execution report (<1000 tokens):

    ```yaml
    status: success|failure|partial
    summary: 'Brief description of agent definition file creation'
    modifications: ['.claude/agents/[name].md']
    outputs:
      agent_file_created: ...
      agent_specifications: {...}
      template_compliance: {...}
      integration_points: [...]
      compliance_mechanisms: [...]
    issues: ['issue1', 'issue2', ...]  # only if problems encountered
    ```
    <<<

**OUTPUT from Phase 2**: Complete agent definition files (1-N) ready for Phase 3 review

#### Phase 3: Review (Subagents)

**What You Send to Subagents**:

In a single message, you spin up subagents to perform comprehensive review in parallel, up to **2** review tasks at a time.

- **[IMPORTANT]** Review is read-only - subagents must NOT modify any resources
- **[IMPORTANT]** Subagents review both file compliance AND integration testing
- **[IMPORTANT]** Use TodoWrite to track review tasks separately

Request each review subagent to perform the following comprehensive review:

    >>>
    **ultrathink: adopt the Agent Integration Validator mindset**

    - You're a **Agent Integration Validator** with expertise in both template compliance and system integration who follows these principles:
      - **Template Compliance**: Verify all agent files follow proper structure
      - **Boundary Validation**: Check that agent boundaries work correctly
      - **Integration Testing**: Validate collaboration patterns and handoffs

    **Review Assignment**
    You're assigned to review the following created agents:

    - Agent files created: [list of .claude/agents/*.md files]
    - Impact analysis from Phase 1: [affected agents and changes]

    **Review Steps**

    1. **File Compliance Review**:
       - Read each created agent file to verify template compliance
       - Check all required sections are present and properly filled
       - Validate agent boundaries and delegation patterns are clear

    2. **Integration Validation**:
       - Test agent functionalities by simulating representative tasks
       - Validate integration points with existing agents
       - Verify cross-agent collaboration patterns work without overlaps
       - Check responsibility boundaries and handoffs function correctly

    **Report**
    **[IMPORTANT]** You MUST return the following review report (<500 tokens):

    ```yaml
    status: pass|fail
    summary: 'Comprehensive review of agent files and integration'
    checks:
      template_compliance: pass|fail
      specification_completeness: pass|fail
      boundary_clarity: pass|fail
      integration_testing: pass|fail
      collaboration_patterns: pass|fail
      system_health: pass|fail
    agents_reviewed: [...]
    fatals: ['issue1', 'issue2', ...]  # Only critical blockers
    warnings: ['warning1', 'warning2', ...]  # Non-blocking issues
    recommendation: proceed|retry|rollback
    ```
    <<<

#### Phase 4: Decision (You)

**What You Do**:

1. **Analyze all reports** from Phases 2 and 3:
   - Review execution reports from agent creation (Phase 2)
   - Review validation reports from integration testing (Phase 3)
   - Check for any fatals or critical issues

2. **Apply decision criteria**:
   - All agent files must be created successfully
   - Template compliance must pass
   - Integration testing must confirm no conflicts
   - System health must be validated

3. **Select next action**:
   - **PROCEED**: All checks pass → Complete workflow successfully
   - **FIX ISSUES**: Minor issues found → Return to Phase 2 for specific fixes → Re-review in Phase 3 → Loop back to Phase 4
   - **ROLLBACK**: Critical failures → Revert all changes → Return to Phase 1 for re-planning

4. **Use TodoWrite** to update final task status:
   - Mark all 'in_progress' items as 'completed' if proceeding
   - Create new fix tasks if issues need resolution
   - Update workflow status to 'completed' or 'retry'

5. **Prepare final outputs**:
   - If PROCEED: Package validation report and agent files for delivery
   - If FIX: Generate specific fix instructions for Phase 2 retry
   - If ROLLBACK: Document failure reasons and cleanup actions

### Workflow Completion

**Report the workflow output as specified**:
