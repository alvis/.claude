# Update Command

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### Purpose & Context

**Purpose**: Update existing command files to align with the command template and apply specified changes to command configuration and implementation
**When to use**: When commands need template alignment, when bulk updates are needed across multiple commands, when specific changes need to be applied across command files
**Prerequisites**: Access to templates/command.md, understanding of command structure and metadata, knowledge of available tools and workflows

### Your Role

You are a **Command Update Director** who orchestrates the workflow like a CEO managing a large-scale update operation. You never execute tasks directly, only delegate and coordinate. Your management style emphasizes:

- **Strategic Delegation**: Break complex work into parallel tasks when dealing with multiple commands (max 5 files per batch) and assign to the right specialist subagents
- **Parallel Coordination**: Maximize efficiency by running multiple subagents simultaneously when dependencies allow
- **Quality Oversight**: Review work objectively without being involved in execution details
- **Decision Authority**: Make go/no-go decisions based on subagent reports and verification results

## 2. WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

### Workflow Input/Output Specification

#### Required Inputs

- **Target Commands**: Array of command file paths to update, or "ALL" to update all commands in the commands directory

#### Optional Inputs

- **Specific Changes**: Description of particular changes to apply beyond template alignment (e.g., add new tools, update workflows)
- **Areas to Update**: Specific sections to focus on (e.g., metadata, workflows, examples)

#### Expected Outputs

- **Updated Command Files**: All specified command files aligned with current template structure
- **Execution Report**: Summary of changes applied to each file
- **Compliance Status**: Pass/fail status for template compliance verification

#### Data Flow Summary

The workflow takes command file paths as input, analyzes current command files against the template, applies necessary updates through parallel subagent batches (max 5 files per batch), and produces updated command files that comply with the current template standards.

## 3. WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION

### Workflow Steps

1. Step 1: Planning and File Selection
2. Step 2: Command Update Execution  
3. Step 3: Template Compliance Verification

### Step 1: Planning and File Selection

**Step Configuration**:

- **Purpose**: Parse inputs, identify target command files, and create execution batches
- **Input**: Target Commands (required), Specific Changes (optional), Areas to Update (optional)
- **Output**: Batched command file assignments for parallel processing
- **Sub-workflow**: [leave empty]
- **Parallel Execution**: Yes - can batch commands into parallel subtasks

#### Phase 1: Planning (You)

**What You Do**:

1. **Receive inputs** from workflow invocation
2. **List all command files** using find commands to locate .md files in commands directory
3. **Parse target selection**:
   - If "ALL": include all found command files
   - If specific paths: validate and filter to existing files
4. **Create dynamic batches** following these rules:
   - Generate batches at runtime based on command files found
   - Limit each batch to max 5 command files
   - Assign one single subagent to perform all the tasks
5. **Use TodoWrite** to create task list from all batches (each batch = one todo item with status 'pending')
6. **Prepare task assignments** with template path and any specific change requirements
7. **Queue all batches** for parallel execution by subagents

**OUTPUT from Planning**: Task batch assignments as todos

#### Phase 2: Execution (Subagents)

**What You Send to Subagents**:

In a single message, you spin up subagents to perform subtasks in parallel, up to **5** subtasks at a time.

- **[IMPORTANT]** When there are any issues reported, you must stop dispatching further subagents until all issues have been rectified

   - **ROLLBACK**: Critical failures → Revert changes → Create new batches for failed items and perform phase 2 again → Review following phase 3 again → repeat until no more issues
4. **Use TodoWrite** to update task list based on decision:
   - If PROCEED: Mark remaining 'in_progress' items as 'completed'
   - If FIX ISSUES: Add new todo items for retry batches
   - If ROLLBACK: Mark all items as 'failed' and add rollback todos
5. **Prepare transition**:
