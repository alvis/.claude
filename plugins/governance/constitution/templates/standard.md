# [Standard Title]

_[Brief description of what this standard covers and its purpose]_

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Replace placeholders in brackets with actual content -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: Use clear, imperative language (e.g., "Use X", "Avoid Y", "Follow Z") -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: Include practical examples for every rule or guideline -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: Keep sections focused and avoid redundancy -->

<!-- INSTRUCTION: All examples must be minimal to illusrate the point and use `...` proactively for brevity. Avoid full example unless it's absolutely necessary -->

## Dependent Standards

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Link to all other related standard files that are needed to make this standard complete, e.g. a typescript standard would requires documentation, functions, naming and general principle standards -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: Use the plugin reference format:
     - Same plugin: standard:name (e.g., standard:react-components)
     - Cross-plugin: plugin:name:standard:name (e.g., plugin:coding:standard:typescript)
     - External resources: Use full URLs
-->

üö® **[IMPORTANT]** You MUST also read the following standards together with this file

- Related Standard 1 (standard:name-of-related-standard) - [How it relates]
- Related Standard 2 (plugin:other-plugin:standard:name) - [How it relates]
- External Resource (https://example.com) - [Why it's relevant]

**Note**: Add a note if this standard requires other plugins to be enabled.

## Core Principles

<!-- INSTRUCTION: List 3-5 fundamental principles that guide this standard -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: Each principle should be actionable and clear -->

### [Principle 1 Name]

[Brief explanation of the principle and why it matters]

```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: [explanation of good practice]
[Code example demonstrating the principle]

// ‚ùå BAD: [explanation of why this is wrong]
[Counter-example showing what to avoid]
```

### [Principle 2 Name]

[Continue pattern for remaining principles...]

## [Main Topic Area 1]

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Break down the standard into logical topic areas -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: Each area should cover a specific aspect comprehensively -->

### [Subtopic 1.1]

[Introduction to the subtopic and when it applies]

```typescript
// standard pattern/template
[Code template or interface definition]

// example implementation
[Concrete example using the pattern]
```

### [Subtopic 1.2]

#### Basic Pattern

```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: [specific practice]
[Good example code]

// ‚ùå BAD: [common mistake]
[Bad example code]
```

#### Advanced Pattern

```typescript
// when you need [specific requirement]:
[Advanced example with annotations]
```

## [Main Topic Area N]

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Repeat the section template above -->

## Quick Reference

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Include tables for quick lookup for patterns that are similar and require extra considerations to decision the pattern to use.  -->

| Pattern | Use Case | Example | Notes |
|---------|----------|---------|-------|
| [Pattern 1] | [When to use] | `[code]` | [Additional context] |
| [Pattern 2] | [When to use] | `[code]` | [Additional context] |

## Patterns & Best Practices

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Provide reusable patterns with clear use cases -->

### [Pattern Name]

**Purpose**: [What problem this pattern solves]

**When to use**:

- [Scenario 1]
- [Scenario 2]

**Implementation**:

```typescript
// pattern template
[Reusable code pattern with placeholders]

// real-world example
[Concrete implementation of the pattern]
```

## Anti-Patterns

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Explicitly call out what NOT to do -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: Explain WHY each anti-pattern is problematic -->

### [Anti-Pattern 1 Name]
