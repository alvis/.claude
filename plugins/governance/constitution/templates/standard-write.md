# [Standard Title]: Compliant Code Patterns

> **Prerequisite**: Read `meta.md` in this directory first for dependencies, exception policy, and rule groups.

<!-- INSTRUCTION: This file is the compliant code patterns tier — used when writing new code -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: Focus on what TO DO, not what to avoid (that belongs in scan.md) -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: Keep examples minimal, using `...` for brevity -->

## Key Principles

<!-- INSTRUCTION: List 5-7 concise bullet points summarizing the most important rules -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: These should be quick-reference reminders, not full explanations -->

- [Principle 1: one-line summary of a key rule or practice]
- [Principle 2: one-line summary of a key rule or practice]
- [Principle 3: one-line summary of a key rule or practice]
- [Principle 4: one-line summary of a key rule or practice]
- [Principle 5: one-line summary of a key rule or practice]

## Core Rules Summary

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Create one subsection per rule group defined in meta.md -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: Each rule gets a one-line summary in bold rule ID + colon + description format -->

### [Rule Group 1 Name] ([PFX]-[GRP1])

- **PFX-GRP1-01**: [One-line rule summary].
- **PFX-GRP1-02**: [One-line rule summary].

### [Rule Group 2 Name] ([PFX]-[GRP2])

- **PFX-GRP2-01**: [One-line rule summary].
- **PFX-GRP2-02**: [One-line rule summary].

### [Rule Group 3 Name] ([PFX]-[GRP3])

- **PFX-GRP3-01**: [One-line rule summary].

## Patterns

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Document reusable compliant patterns specific to this standard's domain -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: Organize into subsections by theme (e.g., "When to X", "Setup Decision", "Naming") -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: Include decision flows, lookup tables, or templates where helpful -->

### [Pattern Category 1]

[Brief explanation of when and how to apply this pattern.]

### [Pattern Category 2]

[Brief explanation with a decision flow or lookup table.]

| [Column 1] | [Column 2] |
|-------------|-------------|
| [Option A]  | [Guidance]  |
| [Option B]  | [Guidance]  |

## Anti-Patterns

<!-- INSTRUCTION: List common mistakes as concise bullet points -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: Each should be a single sentence describing what to avoid -->

- [Anti-pattern 1: brief description of what goes wrong].
- [Anti-pattern 2: brief description of what goes wrong].
- [Anti-pattern 3: brief description of what goes wrong].

## Quick Decision Tree

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Provide a numbered list of decision points for common scenarios -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: Each step should reference the relevant rule ID in parentheses -->
<!-- INSTRUCTION: The tree should guide a developer through the most frequent choices -->

1. [Decision question 1]? If [condition], [action] (`PFX-GRP1-01`).
2. [Decision question 2]? [Guidance] (`PFX-GRP2-01`).
3. [Decision question 3]? [Guidance] (`PFX-GRP3-01`).
