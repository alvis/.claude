# Image generation

Generate or edit images for the current project — website assets, game assets, UI mockups, product mockups, wireframes, logos, photorealistic images, infographics. Defaults to **Google Gemini** (`gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`), with **OpenAI** (`gpt-image-1.5`) via `--provider openai` and **Recraft** (`recraftv4`) via `--provider recraft`. Prefer the bundled CLI for deterministic, reproducible runs. `design` owns web design decisions; `audit` owns visual audits.

## Boundaries

- Use for: generating new images (concept art, product shots, covers, website heroes); editing existing images (inpainting, masked edits, lighting or weather transformations, background replacement, object removal, compositing, transparent background); style-guided generation or editing from a reference image (`--reference`); batch runs; crafting or refining a structured image prompt without producing an image; analyzing or extracting a reusable visual style from a reference image.
- Do not use for: web design direction or page layout decisions (`design`) and visual quality audits (`audit`).

<IMPORTANT>
Never modify `scripts/image_gen.py` or files under `scripts/providers/`. If something is missing, ask the user before doing anything else. Never ask the user to paste an API key in chat — ask them to set it locally and confirm when ready.
</IMPORTANT>

## Inputs

- **Required**: a prompt, an edit instruction with an input image, or a reference image for style analysis.
- **Optional**: reference image(s) for style matching, mask for inpainting, provider/model flags, batch prompt list. All image inputs (`--image`, `--mask`, `--reference`) accept local file paths and `https://` URLs.
- **Prerequisites**: Python 3 with per-provider packages (prefer `uv`; fall back to `python3 -m pip`):
  - Google (default): `uv pip install google-genai pillow`, requires `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (create at <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey>)
  - OpenAI: `uv pip install openai pillow`, requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` (create at <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>)
  - Recraft: `uv pip install openai pillow` (same SDK, custom base_url), requires `RECRAFT_API_TOKEN` (create at <https://app.recraft.ai/profile/api>)

  If a key is missing, walk the user through creating it in the provider UI and setting the environment variable for their OS/shell. If installation is impossible in this environment, name the missing dependency and how to install it locally.

Set the CLI path at the start of any generation workflow; all invocations below assume it:

```bash
export IMAGINE="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/image_gen.py"
```

Run `python "$IMAGINE" generate --help` to see all available params for the current provider.

## Provider and command selection

Provider — first match wins:

- Mask-based editing → `--provider openai`
- Transparent background control (`--background transparent`) → `--provider openai`
- Fine-grained quality/compression/fidelity control → `--provider openai`
- Named artistic styles (Illustration, Pop Art, etc.) → `--provider recraft`
- Custom style ID from reference images → `--provider recraft` with explicit V3 model (`recraftv3` or `recraftv3_vector`) — opt-in, not the default Recraft path
- Style-matched generation from reference images with other providers → analyze the reference visually and encode it as style prompt constraints
- Vector/SVG output → `--provider recraft` with a `_vector` model
- Specific exact pixel dimensions → `--provider recraft` (14+ size presets)
- Otherwise → Google (default, no `--provider` flag)

Command:

- Input image provided, or the user says "edit/retouch/inpaint/mask/translate/localize/change only X" → `generate --image`, e.g. `python "$IMAGINE" generate --image input.png --prompt "Replace the background with a warm sunset gradient"`
- Reference style to apply → add `--reference`, e.g. `python "$IMAGINE" generate --reference style.png --prompt "A man riding a motorcycle on a white background"`
- Many different prompts/assets → `generate-batch`
- Else → `generate`

Assume the user wants a new image unless they explicitly ask for an edit. Provider parameter tables live in [references/providers/google.md](references/providers/google.md), [references/providers/openai.md](references/providers/openai.md), and [references/providers/recraft.md](references/providers/recraft.md); CLI commands, flags, and recipes in [references/cli.md](references/cli.md).

## Workflow

1. **Ask for a reference image** — before anything else, ask whether the user has a reference image or style to match. Do not skip this step.
2. **Extract style** — if a reference is provided, determine the intended provider and model first, then follow [references/style-extraction.md](references/style-extraction.md): Recraft V3 models use `mcp__recraft__create_style` to obtain a `styleID`; all other models get a visually analyzed style prompt (medium, palette, texture, lighting, composition, mood, line quality, detail level) confirmed by the user. Describe the extracted style back to the user before proceeding.
3. **Decide provider + command** — use the selection rules above.
4. **Collect inputs** — gather prompt(s), exact text (verbatim), constraints/avoid list, and any input image(s)/mask(s). For multi-image edits, label each input by index and role; for edits, list invariants explicitly.
5. **Craft the structured prompt** — the primary deliverable; see the next section. Only make implicit details explicit; do not invent new requirements.
6. **Present the prompt for review** — show it to the user for approval. If the request is prompt-only, stop here and deliver the prompt.
7. **Execute** — run the bundled CLI (`python "$IMAGINE" ...`) with sensible defaults, or Recraft MCP tools when working within Recraft's ecosystem (see the MCP Tools section of [references/providers/recraft.md](references/providers/recraft.md) for the tool table and the MCP-vs-CLI decision). For batch runs, write a temporary JSONL, run once, then delete. Use `tempfile.gettempdir()/imagine/` for intermediates; write final artifacts under `output/imagine/` when working in this repo; use `--out` or `--out-dir` with stable, descriptive filenames.
8. **Inspect & iterate** — for complex edits/generations, inspect outputs and validate subject, style, composition, text accuracy, and invariants/avoid items. Make a single targeted change per iteration; only ask a question if a missing detail blocks success.
9. **Deliver** — save/return final outputs and note the final prompt + flags used.
10. Run the verification below; when a check fails, fix the cause (usually one targeted prompt or flag change) and re-run that check. Repeat until every check passes or a concrete blocker remains (missing key, unavailable dependency, provider rejection), then report the blocker instead of looping.

## Structured prompt spec

Classify each request into one of these use-case slugs and keep the slug consistent across prompts and references.

Generate:

- photorealistic-natural — candid/editorial lifestyle scenes with real texture and natural lighting.
- product-mockup — product/packaging shots, catalog imagery, merch concepts.
- ui-mockup — app/web interface mockups that look shippable.
- infographic-diagram — diagrams/infographics with structured layout and text.
- logo-brand — logo/mark exploration, vector-friendly.
- illustration-story — comics, children's book art, narrative scenes.
- stylized-concept — style-driven concept art, 3D/stylized renders.
- historical-scene — period-accurate/world-knowledge scenes.

Edit:

- text-localization — translate/replace in-image text, preserve layout.
- identity-preserve — try-on, person-in-scene; lock face/body/pose.
- precise-object-edit — remove/replace a specific element (incl. interior swaps).
- lighting-weather — time-of-day/season/atmosphere changes only.
- background-extraction — transparent background / clean cutout.
- style-transfer — apply reference style while changing subject/scene.
- compositing — multi-image insert/merge with matched lighting/perspective.
- sketch-to-render — drawing/line art to photoreal render.

Template (include only relevant lines; combined `Lighting/mood:` or separate `Lighting:` + `Vibe/mood:` lines are both accepted):

```
Use case: <taxonomy slug>
Asset type: <where the asset will be used>
Primary request: <user's main prompt>
Scene/background: <environment>
Subject: <main subject>
Style/medium: <photo/illustration/3D/etc>
Composition/framing: <wide/close/top-down; placement>
Lighting: <direction, quality, color temperature>
Vibe/mood: <emotional tone — nostalgic, dramatic, serene, ethereal, etc.>
Color palette: <palette notes>
Materials/textures: <surface details>
Quality: <low/medium/high/auto>
Input fidelity (edits): <low/high>
Text (verbatim): "<exact text>"
Constraints: <must keep/must avoid>
Avoid: <negative constraints>
```

Augmentation rules — augment, never invent:

- Keep it short; add only details the user already implied or provided elsewhere. "A hero image for a landing page" may gain implied layout constraints ("generous negative space on the right for headline text"); it may not gain a mascot, a new subject, or invented brand names/logos.
- Order the spec from global to local: scene/environment first, then subject framing, then fine details (lighting, camera, materials), then constraints/avoid. This reduces randomness in outputs.
- Tailor constraints/composition/quality to the taxonomy slug; use the slug to find the matching example in [references/sample-prompts.md](references/sample-prompts.md).
- If the user gives a broad request (e.g., "Generate images for this website"), propose tasteful, context-appropriate assets and map each to a slug.
- For edits, explicitly list invariants ("change only X; keep Y unchanged") and repeat them every iteration to reduce drift.
- If any critical detail is missing and blocks success, ask a question; otherwise proceed.

Prompting practices (all providers):

- Structure prompts scene → subject → details → constraints; include the intended use (ad, UI mock, infographic) to set polish level.
- Use camera/composition language for photorealism; quote exact text with typography + placement, spelling tricky words letter-by-letter with verbatim rendering required.
- For multi-image inputs, reference images by index and describe how to combine them.
- Start latency-sensitive runs at quality=low; use quality=high for text-heavy or detail-critical outputs; consider `--input-fidelity high` (OpenAI only) for strict identity/layout locks.
- If results feel "tacky", add a brief `Avoid:` line (stock-photo vibe; cheesy lens flare; oversaturated neon; harsh bloom; oversharpening; clutter) and specify restraint ("editorial", "premium", "subtle").
- Use short prompts (2-3 elements) for exploration; structured prompts (all 7 elements: Subject, Composition, Context, Medium, Style, Vibe, Attributes) for production. If a result feels random, add spatial anchors, lighting direction, or mood — not more detail.
- Format-specific cheat sheets (photorealism, illustration, vector/logo, graphic design, 3D) and further principles: [references/prompting.md](references/prompting.md). Copy/paste specs and asset-type templates (website assets, game assets, wireframes, logo): [references/sample-prompts.md](references/sample-prompts.md).

## Verification

- Output files exist at the expected `--out`/`--out-dir` paths and open as valid images (or SVG for vector models).
- Each output satisfies the approved spec: subject, style, composition, verbatim text, and every constraint/avoid item; edit invariants held.
- The final prompt and flags used are recorded alongside the deliverables.
- Temporary batch JSONL and intermediates under the temp directory are deleted.

## Completion

Return the final output paths, the provider/model and command used, the final structured prompt and flags, and any iterations performed. For prompt-only requests, deliver the approved structured prompt. Report `partial` or `blocked` with the concrete missing prerequisite (API key, dependency, provider capability) instead of claiming success.
