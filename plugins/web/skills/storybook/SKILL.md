# Storybook audit

Audit Storybook setup, stories, states, addon panels, and visual evidence. Product files are read-only. The bundled scripts own deterministic work; do not reproduce their logic or use an edit tool to fix findings.

## Inputs, prerequisites, and state

Parse port (default 6006), `--no-spawn`, optional story glob, and grounding cap. `--headed` affects how the model opens Chrome; it is not a script argument.

Require `jq`, `curl`, `agent-browser`, and `magick`; require `claude` only for visual grounding. The target must have `package.json` and a Storybook dependency or script. Confirm the isolated Chrome DevTools session with `list_pages` before scripts that need CDP.

Every command resolves from the installed skill:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}"
URL="http://localhost:${PORT}"
```

Scripts share `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/storybook-audit/.current-run-id`. After lifecycle-up, resolve `RUN_ID` from that file and set `RUN_DIR="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/storybook-audit/$RUN_ID"`. Keep the lifecycle-up JSON, especially `spawned`; teardown only when it is true.

## Ordered lifecycle

1. Detect the project and capture the returned script name:

   ```bash
   "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/detect.sh" --cwd "$PWD"
   ```

   Exit 1 means Storybook is not detected; stop. Exit 2 is a prerequisite/usage failure.

2. Start or reuse Storybook, passing the detected script and project directory:

   ```bash
   "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/lifecycle-up.sh" --port "$PORT" --cwd "$PWD" --script "$SCRIPT_NAME"
   ```

   Add `--no-spawn` only when requested. On failure, preserve stderr and `$RUN_DIR/sb.log` when present. Once lifecycle-up reports `spawned:true`, arrange cleanup so later failure still runs lifecycle-down.

3. Call `list_pages`, open `$URL` with `new_page` (headed only when requested), note the numeric CDP port, then attach with `agent-browser --cdp "$CDP" open "$URL"`.

4. Run setup smoke checks:

   ```bash
   "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/smoke.sh" --cdp "$CDP" --url "$URL"
   ```

   `smoke.sh` may exit zero with failures recorded in `$RUN_DIR/smoke.json`; never skip reading it.

5. Materialize the story index:

   ```bash
   "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/list-stories.sh" --cdp "$CDP" --url "$URL"
   ```

   Read the returned path and `$RUN_DIR/stories.json`. Apply `--story <id-glob>` to the IDs before the loop; an empty match is blocked, not a successful zero-story audit.

6. For each selected story, in stable ID order and serially, run both commands:

   ```bash
   "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/capture-states.sh" --cdp "$CDP" --url "$URL" --story "$ID" --run-dir "$RUN_DIR"
   "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/scrape-panels.sh" --cdp "$CDP" --url "$URL" --story "$ID" --run-dir "$RUN_DIR"
   ```

   Capture produces default, hover, active, and focus-visible state evidence and records pHash dedupe in `states.json`. Panel scraping records `available:false` when optional addons are absent; preserve that as reduced coverage.

7. Ground only screenshots retained by `states.json`, up to `--max-grounding`. For each retained state create `$RUN_DIR/stories/$ID/grounding/` and write the command's JSON output:

   ```bash
   "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/ground.sh" --image "$IMAGE" --state "$STATE" \
     > "$RUN_DIR/stories/$ID/grounding/$STATE.json"
   ```

   `ground.sh` intentionally exits zero on model/tool failure and records the reason in `raw`; such a result is partial coverage, not “no issues.”

8. Aggregate only after all selected story artifacts are present:

   ```bash
   "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/report.sh" --run-dir "$RUN_DIR"
   ```

   Read and return `$RUN_DIR/report.md` and `$RUN_DIR/report.json`. `report.sh` owns P0/P1/P2 bucketing.

9. If and only if lifecycle-up returned `spawned:true`, run:

   ```bash
   "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/lifecycle-down.sh"
   ```

   Never stop a reused Storybook process. Do not close a browser session owned by another skill.

## Optional React standards

For React stories, check whether `react:lint` or the React standards are available before recommending that follow-up. If available, report the relevant source paths and recommend the owner; if unavailable, record “React standards not evaluated.” The web plugin must not assume or silently create a React dependency.

## Verification and failure behavior

Confirm the report scope equals the selected IDs; every story has `states.json` and `panels.json`; retained screenshots exist; every claimed grounded state has valid grounding JSON; focus-visible absence remains a finding; smoke, addon availability, console, a11y, and interaction failures appear in the aggregate; and teardown ownership was honored.

Return `success` only for complete selected-story coverage. Return `partial` when optional addons, ImageMagick, grounding, states, or panel evidence are unavailable but a useful report exists. Return `blocked` for detection, startup, browser, story-selection, or aggregation failures. Include run directory, report paths, selected story count, retained/deduped states, addon availability, and teardown status.
