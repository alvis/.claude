# Visual Grounding Prompts

`ground.sh` selects one section below by state name and embeds the screenshot's absolute path so Claude Code reads the image. Each prompt MUST end with the standard output contract so `ground.sh` can parse the response deterministically.

Cited standards (model should reference mentally when judging):
- `the React plugin accessibility standard` (WCAG 2.1 AA, focus indication, contrast)
- `the Web plugin design standard` (visual hierarchy, spacing, state distinctness)

## default

You are auditing the default rendered state of a Storybook story. Inspect the supplied screenshot and look for issues that violate WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility or the project's visual design standard. Specifically check:

- Text contrast against background (≥ 4.5:1 for body, ≥ 3:1 for large text and UI components).
- Truncation, overflow, or clipped content.
- Misaligned grid, inconsistent spacing, broken layout.
- Missing or placeholder content where real content is expected.
- Obvious render glitches (font fallback flashes, broken icons, missing images).

Be conservative: only report problems clearly visible in the image. Do not speculate about behaviour, hover, or focus — those are separate states.

Output format: first line must be either "ISSUES: none" or "ISSUES: found". If found, list each issue on its own line as "- [severity: low|medium|high] <description>".

## hover

You are auditing the hover state of a Storybook story. The supplied screenshot was taken while the primary interactive element receives a hover event. Compare what you see to the conventions for hover feedback:

- A hover state should be visually distinguishable from the default state (color shift, elevation, underline, cursor cue).
- The change must not destroy contrast — hover text must still meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast.
- Layout must not shift jarringly (jumping by more than a pixel or two) on hover.
- Decorative-only hover (e.g. tooltip appearing off-screen, ghost outlines) counts as low-severity.

If the hover state looks identical to a typical default rendering, report it as a finding (the user expects discoverable affordance).

Output format: first line must be either "ISSUES: none" or "ISSUES: found". If found, list each issue on its own line as "- [severity: low|medium|high] <description>".

## active

You are auditing the active / pressed state of a Storybook story. The screenshot was taken while a mousedown is held on the primary interactive element. Check for:

- A visually distinct pressed appearance (depressed shadow, darker fill, inset border, scale-down).
- Contrast preservation — pressed-state colors must still meet WCAG 2.1 AA.
- No content disappearing or layout collapse during press.
- Press feedback consistent with platform conventions (buttons appear "pushed", links may invert).

If the active state is indistinguishable from default or hover, report it as a medium-severity finding.

Output format: first line must be either "ISSUES: none" or "ISSUES: found". If found, list each issue on its own line as "- [severity: low|medium|high] <description>".

## focus-visible

You are auditing the keyboard focus-visible state of a Storybook story. The screenshot was taken after a synthetic Tab key + focus call on the primary interactive element. Verify there is a visible focus indicator — ring, outline, underline, or color change — clearly distinguishable from the default state. The indicator must:

- Be perceivable (≥ 3:1 contrast against the adjacent background — WCAG 2.4.11/2.4.13).
- Be at least 2 CSS pixels thick on at least one side, or equivalent.
- Not be removed by `outline: none` without a replacement (a common antipattern).
- Not rely solely on color (form factor or shape must change too where possible).

Report a missing or weak focus indicator as a high-severity finding. Report a low-contrast indicator as medium severity.

Output format: first line must be either "ISSUES: none" or "ISSUES: found". If found, list each issue on its own line as "- [severity: low|medium|high] <description>".
