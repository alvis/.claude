# Harness projections

## Support tiers

The files under `plugins/` are the source of truth. Claude Code consumes each `.claude-plugin` manifest; Codex consumes the committed `.codex-plugin` manifests and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. Both are native targets and must remain behaviorally aligned. Maintain the marketplace manifests manually when the plugin set or source manifests change.

Grok Build is a native target with compatibility adapters for individual features: xAI documents direct loading of Claude marketplaces, plugins, skills, agents, MCP servers, hooks, and instructions. The committed `.grok-plugin/marketplace.json` keeps its marketplace catalog aligned with the native manifests.

OpenCode support targets stable V1 only. Its documented extension layout differs from this marketplace, so `scripts/install_opencode.ts` produces a managed directory projection and installs `scripts/opencode_adapter.js` as a local plugin. OpenCode V2 and `opencode2` are outside this contract.

## Native installation and Grok context

`essential:install` and `essential:uninstall` share installation ownership and transaction mechanics under Essential's `scripts/`. A destination-local receipt records installed files and their content hashes; uninstall removes only matching owned content and retains edited files and needed support. Conflicting unowned files are preserved. Installation stages changes, publishes the receipt last, and rolls back failed operations.

Grok alone adds a managed instruction in its user `AGENTS.md` to read the packaged `directions/GROK.md`. The bootstrap invokes its adjacent plugin's `scripts/context.ts` with an explicit main or subagent audience. This loader shares the `grok inspect --json` reader in `scripts/grok.ts` with agent installation, selects every enabled plugin, and reads the applicable payloads before emitting any context. Discovery or read failures return an error; absent optional payloads are skipped. Installer marketplace trust filtering remains separate from context loading.

Canonical instructions remain in the payloads, and their `{{PLUGIN_DIR}}` references resolve against their reported plugin roots. The loader's own path stays anchored to the `GROK.md` that was read, even when discovery reports another Essential installation. Conditional workflows remain lazy. The model must read the bootstrap and loader output; this does not imply automatic `@` expansion or consumption of passive SessionStart output. Reinstallation refreshes moved bootstrap references; uninstall preserves surrounding user rules.

Claude and Codex retain native context hooks. OpenCode V1 retains its receipt-bound system transform. None of these context routes depends on installed specialist agents or another harness's setup. Native installer receipts do not grant removal authority over OpenCode's projection.

## Native plan validation

Claude Code supplies plan prose to Essential's plan-transition `PreToolUse` validator. T3-hosted Codex Plan Mode instead emits a plan response without that tool call. Essential's Codex-only Stop adapter reads the newest assistant response for the current `turn_id` from `transcript_path`, requires one complete `<proposed_plan>` block, and delegates its body to the same heading validator. The first failure blocks for one corrective continuation; a second failure stops visibly. Because Stop follows response emission, it cannot retract a malformed plan already rendered by T3.

Grok Build's plan tool supplies no plan body and ignores blocking Stop output. OpenCode V1 exposes neither a native plan-transition event nor cancellable Stop, so their receipts remain adapted and unavailable respectively.

```

The installer accepts explicit plugin names or `--all`, resolves dependencies before dependents, and obtains each plugin and skill inventory from `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard`. It reads modified tracked bytes from the worktree, skips deleted entries, and rejects source symlinks and other non-regular entries before mutating the target. Ignored environments, caches, and build artifacts therefore cannot enter either projection location.

Every output is staged as a regular file. The installer preflights destination paths, refuses unmanaged collisions, backs up prior managed files, installs with atomic renames, and rolls back if an installation step fails. The schema-v2 manifest is the final commit marker and records every managed path, source digest, and resolved hook receipt. Repeating an install with the same worktree produces the same inventory and digests.

A later run may replace or retire only authenticated recorded paths. Existing schema-v2 paths must be regular files with matching digests. An independently authenticated schema-v1 projection may also retire non-desired legacy symlinks: the installer moves the link itself into its transaction backup and never reads or changes its target. Modified, forged, overlapping, unowned, and current-schema non-regular claims remain fatal.

Project scope writes `<project>/.opencode`. User scope writes `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/opencode`. The installer does not alter either OpenCode configuration file; V1 auto-discovers the local plugin and projected definitions.

## Identifier and resource mapping

OpenCode requires a globally unique lowercase kebab skill directory and matching frontmatter name. The projector therefore maps `plugin:skill` to `plugin-skill`. A generated command with the same hyphenated name loads that skill and forwards `$ARGUMENTS`. This lets `coding:lint` and `react:lint` coexist as `coding-lint` and `react-lint`.

Each projected skill retains its resource tree. Markdown links that leave the skill directory are retargeted into `alvis/plugins/<plugin>`, where the complete resolved plugin bundles preserve cross-plugin references, standards, templates, scripts, and hook payloads. Runtime context also states that `@plugin:path` means that bundled path.

Agent names remain canonical because routing payloads refer to them. A duplicate agent name across selected plugins aborts projection. The generator combines canonical metadata and body with the Claude initial prompt, maps `maxTurns` to OpenCode `steps`, translates supported colors, and omits `model` so the invoking provider remains authoritative.

## Runtime adapter

OpenCode V1 loads `plugins/alvis-marketplace.js` without extra npm dependencies. <!-- doc-path-gate: ignore -->
The adapter validates the manifest's resolved hook receipts, then:

- adds absent MCP definitions to the merged configuration, mapping Claude HTTP servers to OpenCode remote servers and command definitions to local arrays;
- preserves an existing user or project MCP entry with the same name and logs a warning;
- builds root, child, and unresolved context from each receipt's audience, adding `MAINAGENT` for root sessions without requiring an installed lead;
- executes receipt-bound context scripts and payloads through `experimental.chat.system.transform`, mutating `output.system` in place;
- iterates receipt-bound before hooks for `question`, `task`, available plan aliases, and skill-scoped command aliases, rejecting denials before execution;
- retains allow advice by session and call identity, appends it to the matching result, and clears it after consumption, session idle/deletion, or disposal;
- runs receipt-bound post-rewrite verification after command execution without replacing existing output or metadata;
- gives each spawned script a cloned environment whose conflicting native roots are cleared and whose child-local `PLUGIN_ROOT` names the verified projected bundle, without mutating `process.env`; and
- disables a user-scope adapter when the active worktree has a complete project projection, preventing double injection. Suppression verifies the matching contract, adapter, and every receipt-bound runtime resource; a marker-only or incomplete directory leaves the user adapter active.

The system-transform hook is experimental in the V1 plugin type, so its matrix status is 🧪. Registering known plan aliases preserves their validators when the host emits a matching tool event, but V1 has no native plan-transition event. Stop has no blocking event and is injected only as labelled advisory context; the adapter never creates a synthetic turn. Task sessions support child agents, but not persistent teammate identities or direct peer messaging. If session lookup cannot establish root or child status, the adapter injects no `MAINAGENT` or `SUBAGENT` payload; it never promotes an unresolved session to root behavior.

## Fail-closed boundaries

Agent overlays may contain security-sensitive Claude hooks. The projector maps the two recognized critic write fences to OpenCode granular edit permissions, limits edits to rooted agent-memory and canonical review-state paths, denies shell and external-directory access for those critics, and rejects a canonical hook unless its complete policy digest is recognized. It does not infer models, permission modes, isolation, background execution, or memory features that OpenCode does not document as equivalent.

Runtime reads are receipt-bound. The installer rejects any global or skill-frontmatter hook whose event, matcher, command shape, script, payload, or requirements are not represented in `scripts/opencode_contract.json`. Plugin names and bundle paths must match that protocol; every executable, supporting resource, or payload must remain beneath its regular-file bundle path and match its recorded digest before it is read or spawned. The compatibility matrix uses the same hook authority, so an unsupported registration cannot silently disappear from the matrix.

Replacement authority is also bound outside the projected tree. The installer stores a target-specific ownership record and durable transaction journal under `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/alvis-opencode-v1/`. A manifest without the matching external record is unmanaged even when its paths and digests look canonical. Before the first rename, the installer fsyncs a journal containing the prior and desired path digests; a later non-dry run rolls back an interrupted transaction or cleans up a transaction whose ownership commit completed. Schema-v1 authentication uses the legacy manifest and external receipt schema independently of the current contract, then commits schema-v2 ownership only after the new install succeeds. Dry-run never mutates recovery state and stops when recovery is required.

`COMPATIBILITY.md` is maintained from current skill and agent sources plus explicit cross-harness exceptions. Its emoji is part of the claim: adapted, experimental, external, and unavailable features must never be rewritten as native support.
