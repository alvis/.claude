# Implement Data Controller

Implement a complete data controller for a set of entities that are closely related to a feature or business area by executing data schema implementation and data operations implementation workflows.

## üéØ Purpose & Scope

**What this command does NOT do:**

- Create business logic or service layer code
- Implement frontend components or UI elements
- Handle authentication or authorization logic
- Generate migration files for production deployment
- Create API endpoints or route handlers

**When to REJECT:**

- When the controller name doesn't exist in the Notion Data Controllers database
- When project structure is missing required Prisma configuration
- When requesting implementation of non-data operations (business logic)
- When the area filter specifies invalid operation types or entities

## üìä Dynamic Context

- **[IMPORTANT]** At the start of the command, you MUST run the command to load all the context below

### System State

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --short`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`
- Working directory: !`pwd`
- Modified files: !`git diff --name-only`
- Staged files: !`git diff --cached --name-only`

### Project Context

- Workflows: !`find "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/constitutions/workflows" "$HOME/.claude/constitutions/workflows" -type f -name '*.md' 2>/dev/null | sed "s|^$(pwd)/||" || echo "No workflows found"`
- Standards: !`find "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/constitutions/standards" "$HOME/.claude/constitutions/standards" -type f -name '*.md' 2>/dev/null | sed "s|^$(pwd)/||" || echo "No workflows found"`

## üîÑ Workflow

ultrathink: you'd perform the following steps

### Step 1: Follow Implement Data Schema Workflow

- Execute @constitutions/workflows/theriety/implement-data-schema.md

### Step 2: Follow Implement Data Operation Workflow

- Execute @constitutions/workflows/theriety/implement-data-operation.md

### Step 3: Reporting

**Output Format:**

## üìù Examples

### Simple Usage

```bash
/implement-data-controller "product-offering"
# implements complete data controller for product offering entities
# creates all schemas and operations found in notion specification
```

### Complex Usage with Operations Filter

```bash
/implement-data-controller "user-management" --area="get,set,list"
# implements only get, set, and list operations for user management
# excludes drop or other operations not specified
```

### Entity-Specific Implementation

```bash
/implement-data-controller "billing" --area="invoice,payment"
# implements only invoice and payment entities from billing controller
# skips other entities that may exist in the specification
```

### Complete Feature Implementation

```bash
/implement-data-controller "subscription-management"
# implements all entities and operations for subscription management
# includes schema generation, operation implementation, and full test coverage
```

### Error Case Handling

```bash
/implement-data-controller "non-existent-controller"
# Error: Controller 'non-existent-controller' not found in Notion database
# Suggestion: Check available controllers with notion search
# Alternative: Use '/implement-data-controller --list' to see valid options
```

### With Specific Operation Types

```bash
/implement-data-controller "analytics" --area="drop"
# implements only drop operations for analytics entities
# ensures proper status-based logic for data removal
```
