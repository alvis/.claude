- Development workflows (coding, testing, deployment)
- Review and verification procedures
- Quality assurance processes

**Key Sections**:
- Purpose, When to use, Prerequisites
- Expert Role definition
- Numbered steps with examples
- Tool recommendations
- Standards to follow (mandatory)
- Quality gates/verification
- Common issues and solutions

### üìê standard.md
**Purpose**: Template for creating new standards documents in `constitutions/standards/`

Use this template when you need to document:
- Coding conventions and patterns
- Technical requirements and specifications
- Best practices and anti-patterns
- Security and performance guidelines

**Key Sections**:
- Core principles
- Topic areas with examples
- Patterns and anti-patterns
- Quick reference tables
- Testing standards
- Migration guides

### ü§ñ agent.md
**Purpose**: Template for defining AI agent personas in `.claude/agents/`

Use this template when you need to create:
- Specialized agent roles
- Agent capabilities and expertise
- Collaboration protocols
- Tool access definitions

### üîß command.md
**Purpose**: Template for creating slash commands in `commands/`

Use this template when you need to create:
- Custom slash commands for common tasks
- Automated workflows triggered by commands
- Tool orchestration commands
- Batch operations

## Usage Guidelines

### For Workflows

1. **Start with workflow.md** when documenting any process
2. Replace all `[placeholders]` with specific content
3. Include concrete examples for every step
4. Reference relevant standards as MANDATORY
5. Define clear verification criteria

### For Standards

1. **Start with standard.md** when documenting requirements
2. Focus on WHAT should be done (workflows cover HOW)
3. Include both good (‚úÖ) and bad (‚ùå) examples
4. Provide quick reference tables for easy lookup
5. Include migration guides when replacing old patterns

### Workflow vs Standard

| Aspect | Workflow | Standard |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Focus** | HOW to do something | WHAT the rules are |
| **Structure** | Sequential steps | Topic-based sections |
| **Examples** | Step-by-step commands | Patterns and anti-patterns |
| **Verification** | Quality gates and checks | Compliance checklists |
| **When to use** | Specific task triggers | General requirements |

```

## Best Practices

### When Creating Workflows

- ‚úÖ Make steps actionable and specific
- ‚úÖ Include tool recommendations for each phase
- ‚úÖ Reference standards as mandatory requirements
- ‚úÖ Define measurable success criteria
- ‚úÖ Document common failure scenarios

### When Creating Standards

- ‚úÖ Be prescriptive about requirements
- ‚úÖ Explain the WHY behind each rule
- ‚úÖ Provide code examples for every guideline
- ‚úÖ Include quick decision matrices
- ‚úÖ Define enforcement mechanisms

### General Guidelines

1. **Keep AI instructions** - Don't remove the `<!-- INSTRUCTION -->` comments
2. **Maintain consistency** - Follow the same structure as existing documents
3. **Be complete** - Replace ALL placeholders with real content
4. **Test examples** - Ensure all code examples are correct
5. **Cross-reference** - Link to related workflows and standards

## File Naming Conventions

### Workflows
```
constitutions/workflows/[category]/[verb]-[noun].md
Examples:
- build-service.md
- review-code.md
- verify-auth-scope.md
```

### Standards
```
constitutions/standards/[category]/[topic].md
Examples:
- typescript.md
- testing.md
```

## Maintenance

- Review templates quarterly for updates
- Keep AI instruction comments current
- Update examples to match current practices
- Add new optional sections as patterns emerge
- Ensure templates reflect actual document structures
