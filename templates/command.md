# Executes basic task with minimal configuration
```

### Complex Usage with Options

```bash
/command-name "primary-target" --scope="specific-area" --verify
# Executes with additional constraints and verification
```

### Delegation Example

```bash
/command-name "large-task"
# Automatically delegates to:
#   - Agent A: Handles component 1
#   - Agent B: Handles component 2 (parallel)
#   - Agent C: Verification (after A & B complete)
```

### Error Case Handling

```bash
/command-name "invalid-target"
# Error: Target not found
# Suggestion: Check available targets with 'ls targets/'
# Alternative: Use '/command-name --list' to see valid options
```

### With Workflow Override

```bash
/command-name "task" --workflow="custom-workflow.md"
# Uses specified workflow instead of auto-detected one
```
